Sir Isaac Newton (1642–1727) was an English mathematician, physicist, astronomer, and natural philosopher. He is regarded as one of the most influential scientists in history, laying the foundations for classical mechanics and modern physics.

## Early Life

- Born on December 25, 1642 in Woolsthorpe, Lincolnshire, England.  
- Studied at Trinity College, Cambridge.  
- Developed early interests in mathematics, optics, and astronomy.  

## Major Contributions

1. **Mathematics**  
   - Invented calculus (independently alongside Leibniz).  
   - Advanced algebra and geometry.  

2. **Physics**  
   - Formulated the **Three Laws of Motion**.  
   - Established the law of **Universal Gravitation**.  
   - Explained planetary motion and tides.  

3. **Optics**  
   - Demonstrated that white light is composed of a spectrum of colors.  
   - Invented the reflecting telescope.  

4. **Astronomy**  
   - Applied gravitational theory to explain planetary orbits.  
   - Supported heliocentric theory with mathematical proof.  

## Key Works

- *Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica* (1687) – Foundation of classical mechanics.  
- *Opticks* (1704) – Groundbreaking work on light and color.  

## Later Life

- Served as Master of the Royal Mint, reforming England’s currency.  
- Elected President of the Royal Society.  
- Knighted by Queen Anne in 1705.  

## Legacy

* Revolutionized science with laws of motion and gravity.  
* His work remained the dominant scientific paradigm until Einstein’s relativity.  
* Remembered as a pioneer of the Scientific Revolution.  

## Key Dates

- **1642** – Born in Woolsthorpe, England  
- **1665–1666** – “Annus Mirabilis” discoveries during plague years  
- **1687** – Publication of *Principia Mathematica*  
- **1704** – Publication of *Opticks*  
- **1727** – Died in London, buried in Westminster Abbey
