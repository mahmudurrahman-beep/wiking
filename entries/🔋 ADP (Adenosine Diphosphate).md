## 📖 Introduction
**ADP** is a nucleotide that plays a central role in cellular energy transfer.  
It is formed when **ATP (adenosine triphosphate)** loses one phosphate group, releasing energy for biological processes.

## 🕰️ History / Origins
- Discovered in the early **20th century** during studies of cellular metabolism.  
- Identified as part of the **ATP–ADP cycle**, crucial for energy flow in living cells.  
- Research into ADP helped explain how cells regenerate energy through respiration.

## 🔑 Key Features
- 🧬 **Structure**:  
  - Adenine (nitrogenous base).  
  - Ribose (sugar).  
  - Two phosphate groups (diphosphate chain).  
- ⚡ **Function**:  
  - Acts as an intermediate in energy transfer.  
  - Converted back into ATP during cellular respiration (ADP + Pi → ATP).  
  - Involved in muscle contraction, active transport, and biosynthesis.  
- 🔄 **Cycle**:  
  - ATP → ADP + Pi (energy released).  
  - ADP + Pi → ATP (energy stored).  

## 🌍 Legacy / Impact
- ADP is essential for maintaining the **energy balance of cells**.  
- Understanding ADP has advanced knowledge of **metabolism, exercise physiology, and bioenergetics**.  
- Central to research in medicine, sports science, and biotechnology.

## 🌟 Fun Fact
Your body recycles ADP into ATP **hundreds of times per day per molecule** — making it one of the busiest molecules in existence!
