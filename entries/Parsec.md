## Introduction
A **parsec** is a unit of distance used in astronomy, equal to about **3.26 light-years** or **31 trillion kilometers (19 trillion miles)**. It is commonly used to measure distances to stars and galaxies beyond our Solar System.

## History / Origins
- The term comes from **"parallax of one arcsecond"**.  
- First introduced in the early 20th century as a practical way to express astronomical distances.  
- Based on the method of measuring stellar parallax — the apparent shift of a star’s position due to Earth’s orbit around the Sun.  

## Key Features
- 1 parsec = 3.26 light-years = 206,265 astronomical units (AU).  
- Distances to nearby stars are often given in parsecs.  
- Larger scales use kiloparsecs (kpc) and megaparsecs (Mpc).  

## Legacy / Impact
- Essential in astronomy for mapping the universe.  
- Used in cosmology to measure distances between galaxies and clusters.  
- Helps scientists understand the scale of the cosmos.  

## Fun Fact 🌟
The term **parsec** famously appeared in *Star Wars*, when Han Solo claimed the Millennium Falcon made the **Kessel Run in less than 12 parsecs** — though a parsec is a unit of distance, not time!
