## 📖 Introduction
**RNA** is a nucleic acid that plays essential roles in coding, decoding, regulation, and expression of genes.  
It is structurally similar to DNA but usually single‑stranded and more versatile in function.

## 🕰️ History / Origins
- Discovered in the **19th century** as a component of cells.  
- Its role in protein synthesis was clarified in the **20th century**.  
- The **RNA world hypothesis** suggests RNA may have been the first genetic material in early life.  

## 🔑 Key Features
- **Structure**: Single‑stranded chain of nucleotides.  
- **Bases**: Adenine (A), Uracil (U), Cytosine (C), Guanine (G).  
  - A pairs with U, G pairs with C.  
- **Types of RNA**:  
  - **mRNA (messenger RNA)** – carries genetic code from DNA to ribosomes.  
  - **tRNA (transfer RNA)** – brings amino acids to ribosomes during protein synthesis.  
  - **rRNA (ribosomal RNA)** – forms the core of ribosome structure and catalyzes protein synthesis.  
  - **Other RNAs** – miRNA, siRNA, snRNA, involved in regulation and splicing.  
- **Functions**:  
  - Protein synthesis.  
  - Gene regulation.  
  - Catalytic activity (ribozymes).  

## 🌍 Legacy / Impact
- Central to understanding **gene expression** and **molecular biology**.  
- RNA technologies underpin **vaccines (e.g., mRNA vaccines)**, gene silencing, and biotechnology.  
- RNA research continues to revolutionize medicine and evolutionary biology.  

## 🌟 Fun Fact
Some viruses, like **coronaviruses**, use RNA instead of DNA as their genetic material!
