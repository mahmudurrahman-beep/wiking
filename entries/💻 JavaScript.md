# 💻 JavaScript

## 📖 Introduction
**JavaScript** is a high‑level, dynamic programming language.  
It is the **scripting language of the web**, enabling interactive websites, real‑time updates, and complex applications.  
Beyond browsers, JavaScript is also used in **servers (Node.js)**, **databases**, and even **desktop/mobile apps**.

## 🕰️ History / Origins
- **1995**: Created by **Brendan Eich** at Netscape in just 10 days.  
- Originally called **Mocha**, then **LiveScript**, before becoming **JavaScript**.  
- Standardized as **ECMAScript** by **ECMA International**.  
- Modern versions (ES6/ES2015 and beyond) added classes, modules, async/await, and more.

## 🔑 Key Features
- 🌐 **Cross‑platform**: Runs in all major browsers and on servers.  
- ⚡ **Event‑driven**: Responds to user actions like clicks, typing, or scrolling.  
- 🧩 **Versatile**: Supports functional, object‑oriented, and imperative programming.  
- 📦 **Ecosystem**: Rich libraries and frameworks (React, Angular, Vue, Express).  
- 🔄 **Dynamic**: Variables, objects, and functions can be created and modified at runtime.  

## 🌍 Legacy / Impact
- Powers **over 98% of websites** worldwide.  
- Backbone of modern **web apps** (e.g., Gmail, Facebook, Twitter).  
- Expanded into **server‑side programming** with Node.js.  
- Integral to **full‑stack development** alongside HTML and CSS.  

## 🌟 Fun Fact
Despite its name, **JavaScript is not related to Java** — the name was a marketing move to ride Java’s popularity in the 1990s.
