## Definition
**Atomic fission** is a nuclear reaction in which the nucleus of a heavy atom (such as uranium‑235 or plutonium‑239) splits into two or more smaller nuclei, releasing a large amount of energy. This process also produces free neutrons, which can trigger further fission reactions in a chain reaction.

## Discovery
- **1938** – Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann discovered nuclear fission in uranium.  
- **1939** – Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch explained the process theoretically.  
- This discovery laid the foundation for both nuclear power and nuclear weapons.  

## How It Works
1. A neutron strikes a heavy nucleus (e.g., uranium‑235).  
2. The nucleus splits into two smaller nuclei (fission fragments).  
3. Several neutrons are released.  
4. A large amount of energy is released as kinetic energy and radiation.  
5. The released neutrons can cause further fission, creating a **chain reaction**.  

## Applications
- **Nuclear Power Plants** – Controlled chain reactions generate heat, which produces steam to drive turbines and generate electricity.  
- **Nuclear Weapons** – Uncontrolled chain reactions produce massive explosive energy.  
- **Medical Isotopes** – Fission products are used in medical imaging and cancer treatment.  

## Advantages
- Produces large amounts of energy from small amounts of fuel.  
- Reduces dependence on fossil fuels.  
- Provides reliable base‑load electricity.  

## Disadvantages and Risks
- **Radioactive Waste** – Long‑term storage and disposal challenges.  
- **Accidents** – Risk of meltdowns (e.g., Chernobyl, Fukushima).  
- **Nuclear Proliferation** – Technology can be used for weapons.  
- **Environmental Impact** – Mining and waste disposal affect ecosystems.  

## Key Isotopes Used
- **Uranium‑235** – Commonly used in reactors and weapons.  
- **Plutonium‑239** – Produced in reactors, used in weapons.  
- **Uranium‑233** – Can be bred from thorium.  

## Legacy
*Atomic fission remains a cornerstone of nuclear science, powering electricity generation worldwide while raising profound ethical, environmental, and security challenges.*
