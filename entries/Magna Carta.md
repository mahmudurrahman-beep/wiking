## Definition
The **Magna Carta** (Latin for “Great Charter”) is a historic document signed on **15 June 1215** by King John of England under pressure from rebel barons. It established limits on royal authority and affirmed certain legal rights.

## Background
- King John’s heavy taxation and failed military campaigns angered the barons.  
- Archbishop Stephen Langton helped draft the charter to make peace.  
- The document was sealed at **Runnymede**, near Windsor.  

## Key Provisions
- **Rule of Law:** The king is not above the law.  
- **Due Process:** No free man could be imprisoned without lawful judgment (“habeas corpus”).  
- **Taxation:** Required baronial consent for new taxes.  
- **Church Rights:** Protected the freedom of the English Church.  
- **Justice:** Established fair trials and limits on arbitrary justice.  

## Historical Significance
- Initially annulled by Pope Innocent III, but reissued several times (1216, 1217, 1225).  
- Influenced the development of **English common law**.  
- Inspired later constitutional documents, including the **Petition of Right (1628)**, the **English Bill of Rights (1689)**, and the **U.S. Constitution (1787)**.  

## Legacy
The Magna Carta is seen as a **symbol of liberty and justice**, even though many of its clauses were specific to medieval feudal society. Its enduring principle is that **no one, not even a king, is above the law**.
