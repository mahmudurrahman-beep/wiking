# LASIK Eye Surgery

## 📖 What It Is
LASIK is a **refractive surgery** that reshapes the cornea (the clear front part of the eye) using an excimer laser.  
By changing the cornea’s curvature, LASIK improves the eye’s ability to focus light correctly on the retina.

## 🕰️ Procedure Steps
1. A thin flap is created in the cornea (using a microkeratome blade or femtosecond laser).  
2. The flap is lifted, and the excimer laser reshapes the underlying corneal tissue.  
3. The flap is repositioned, acting as a natural bandage.  

## 🔑 Benefits
- Rapid vision improvement (often within 24 hours).  
- Minimal pain during recovery.  
- Reduced dependence on glasses or contact lenses.  
- Long-lasting results for most patients.  

## ⚠️ Risks & Considerations
- Dry eyes (common temporary side effect).  
- Glare, halos, or double vision at night.  
- Rare complications: infection, flap issues, or under/over-correction.  
- Not suitable for everyone (e.g., very thin corneas, certain eye diseases).  

## 🌍 Recovery
- Vision stabilizes within a few weeks.  
- Eye drops and protective shields are used during healing.  
- Follow-up visits ensure proper recovery.  

## 🌟 Fun Fact
LASIK was first performed in **1990**, and millions of people worldwide have undergone the procedure since then.
