## Introduction
**Plutonium** is a chemical element with the symbol **Pu** and atomic number **94**. It is a dense, silvery‑gray, radioactive metal belonging to the actinide series. Plutonium is best known for its use in nuclear weapons and nuclear reactors.

## History / Origins
- Discovered in **1940** by scientists Glenn T. Seaborg, Edwin McMillan, Joseph W. Kennedy, and Arthur Wahl at the University of California, Berkeley.  
- Named after the dwarf planet **Pluto**, following the naming convention after Uranium (Uranus) and Neptunium (Neptune).  
- First produced by bombarding uranium‑238 with deuterons in a cyclotron.  
- Played a central role in the **Manhattan Project** during World War II.  

## Key Features
- **Appearance**: Silvery‑gray metal that tarnishes quickly in air.  
- **Radioactivity**: Highly radioactive, emitting alpha particles.  
- **Isotopes**:  
  - **Pu‑239** – fissile, used in nuclear weapons and reactors.  
  - **Pu‑238** – used as a heat source in radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) for spacecraft.  
- **Properties**: Dense, malleable, and capable of sustaining a nuclear chain reaction.  
- **Occurrence**: Rare in nature; mostly produced artificially in nuclear reactors.  

## Uses
- **Nuclear Weapons**: Core material in atomic bombs (e.g., “Fat Man” dropped on Nagasaki in 1945).  
- **Nuclear Reactors**: Fuel in mixed oxide (MOX) fuel.  
- **Space Exploration**: Pu‑238 powers spacecraft such as Voyager, Cassini, and Mars rovers.  

## Legacy / Impact
- Central to the nuclear age, shaping global politics and security.  
- Environmental and health concerns due to its toxicity and long half‑life.  
- Symbol of both technological progress and existential risk.  

## Fun Fact 🌟
A small amount of plutonium can generate enormous energy — just a few kilograms can power a spacecraft for decades.
