## Introduction
**Orientalism** refers to the study, representation, and interpretation of the cultures of the Middle East, Asia, and North Africa by Western scholars, artists, and writers. The term gained new meaning after **Edward Said’s 1978 book *Orientalism***, which critiqued how the West constructed stereotypes about the “Orient” to justify colonial domination.

## History / Origins
- Originally, “Orientalism” described academic study of Eastern languages, literature, and history.  
- In the 18th and 19th centuries, European scholars and artists produced works depicting the “exotic East.”  
- Edward Said redefined the term in 1978, arguing that Orientalism was a system of thought that reinforced Western superiority and colonial power.  

## Key Features
- **Academic Discipline**: Early Orientalism focused on philology, archaeology, and cultural studies.  
- **Art and Literature**: Romanticized depictions of Eastern landscapes, harems, and “mystical” traditions.  
- **Critique by Said**: Orientalism is not neutral; it reflects power dynamics and Western bias.  
- **Stereotypes**: The Orient portrayed as backward, exotic, or dangerous compared to the rational, modern West.  

## Legacy / Impact
- Said’s work reshaped cultural studies, postcolonial theory, and literary criticism.  
- Sparked debates about representation, identity, and the politics of knowledge.  
- Continues to influence discussions about how cultures are studied and portrayed in media and academia.  

## Fun Fact 🌟
The word **“Orient”** simply means “East,” but in Western art and literature it came to symbolize mystery, sensuality, and difference.
