Albert Einstein (1879–1955) was a German‑born theoretical physicist, widely regarded as one of the greatest scientific minds of the 20th century. He is best known for developing the theory of relativity, which revolutionized modern physics.

## Early Life

- Born on March 14, 1879 in Ulm, Germany.  
- Studied at the Polytechnic Institute in Zurich, Switzerland.  
- Worked at the Swiss Patent Office, where he developed many of his early ideas.  

## Major Contributions

1. **Theory of Special Relativity (1905)**  
   - Introduced the equation *E = mc²*, showing the equivalence of mass and energy.  

2. **Theory of General Relativity (1915)**  
   - Explained gravity as the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy.  
   - Confirmed by the 1919 solar eclipse observations.  

3. **Quantum Theory Contributions**  
   - Explained the photoelectric effect (Nobel Prize, 1921).  
   - Contributed to the development of quantum mechanics, though he remained skeptical of its probabilistic nature.  

4. **Other Work**  
   - Brownian motion explanation, supporting atomic theory.  
   - Contributions to cosmology, unified field theory, and statistical mechanics.  

## Later Life

- Emigrated to the United States in 1933, fleeing Nazi Germany.  
- Worked at Princeton University’s Institute for Advanced Study.  
- Advocated for peace, civil rights, and the regulation of nuclear weapons.  

## Legacy

* Revolutionized physics with relativity and quantum theory.
