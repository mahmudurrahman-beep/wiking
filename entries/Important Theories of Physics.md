## Classical Mechanics (Newtonian Mechanics)
- Developed by **Isaac Newton** in the 17th century.  
- Describes the motion of objects under forces using Newton’s three laws of motion.  
- Foundation for engineering, astronomy, and everyday physics.  

---

## Universal Gravitation
- Proposed by **Isaac Newton** in 1687.  
- States that every mass attracts every other mass with a force proportional to their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance.  
- Explained planetary motion and tides.  

---

## Electromagnetism
- Unified by **James Clerk Maxwell** in the 19th century.  
- Maxwell’s equations describe how electric and magnetic fields interact and propagate as waves.  
- Basis for radio, electricity, and modern communications.  

---

## Thermodynamics
- Developed in the 18th–19th centuries.  
- Governs heat, energy, and work.  
- Key laws:  
  1. Conservation of energy (First Law).  
  2. Entropy always increases (Second Law).  
  3. Absolute zero cannot be reached (Third Law).

## Special Relativity
- Proposed by **Albert Einstein** in 1905.  
- Space and time are relative, not absolute.  
- Famous equation: *E = mc²*.  
- Revolutionized understanding of motion at high speeds.  

---

## General Relativity
- Developed by **Albert Einstein** in 1915.  
- Gravity is the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy.  
- Predicts black holes, gravitational waves, and cosmic expansion.  

---

## Quantum Mechanics
- Emerged in the early 20th century.  
- Describes behavior of particles at atomic and subatomic scales.  
- Key principles: wave‑particle duality, uncertainty principle, superposition.  
- Foundation of modern electronics and chemistry.  

---

## Quantum Field Theory
- Extends quantum mechanics to fields.  
- Basis for the **Standard Model of Particle Physics**.  
- Explains electromagnetic, weak, and strong nuclear interactions.  

---

## The Standard Model
- Developed in the mid‑20th century.  
- Classifies fundamental particles (quarks, leptons, bosons).  
- Explains three of the four fundamental forces (excluding gravity).  

---

## Big Bang Theory
- Cosmological model of the universe’s origin.  
- Universe began ~13.8 billion years ago from a hot, dense state.  
- Supported by cosmic microwave background radiation and galaxy redshifts.  

---

## String Theory (and M‑Theory)
- Modern theoretical framework attempting to unify all forces.  
- Suggests particles are tiny vibrating strings.  
- Explores extra dimensions and quantum gravity.  

---

## Chaos Theory
- Studies systems highly sensitive to initial conditions.  
- Famous example: “Butterfly Effect.”  
- Important in weather prediction, fluid dynamics, and nonlinear systems.  

---

## Modern Developments
- **Dark Matter and Dark Energy** – explain unseen mass and accelerating expansion of the universe.  
- **Quantum Gravity** – attempts to unify general relativity and quantum mechanics.  
- **Higgs Mechanism** – explains how particles acquire mass (confirmed in 2012 at CERN).
