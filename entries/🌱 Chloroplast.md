## 📖 Introduction
**Chloroplasts** are specialized organelles found in plant and algal cells.  
They are the sites of **photosynthesis**, converting light energy into chemical energy stored in glucose.  
Chloroplasts are vital for sustaining life on Earth by producing oxygen and organic compounds.

## 🕰️ History / Origins
- First observed in the **19th century** under microscopes.  
- The term *chloroplast* comes from Greek: *chloros* (green) + *plastos* (formed).  
- Their evolutionary origin is explained by the **endosymbiotic theory**, which suggests chloroplasts evolved from cyanobacteria engulfed by ancestral eukaryotic cells.

## 🔑 Key Features
- 🧬 **Structure**:  
  - Double membrane envelope.  
  - Internal system of thylakoids stacked into **grana**.  
  - Stroma (fluid matrix containing enzymes, DNA, and ribosomes).  
- 🌞 **Functions**:  
  - Photosynthesis (light reactions and Calvin cycle).  
  - Production of ATP and NADPH.  
  - Synthesis of fatty acids, amino acids, and pigments.  
- 🌱 **Pigments**:  
  - Chlorophyll a and b (capture light energy).  
  - Carotenoids (assist in light absorption and photoprotection).  

## 🌍 Legacy / Impact
- Chloroplasts are essential for **life on Earth**, driving the global carbon and oxygen cycles.  
- Their study has advanced agriculture, bioengineering, and renewable energy research.  
- Central to understanding climate change and sustainable ecosystems.  

## 🌟 Fun Fact
Each square millimeter of a leaf can contain **up to half a million chloroplasts**, all working together to capture sunlight!
