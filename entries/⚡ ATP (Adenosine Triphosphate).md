## 📖 Introduction
**ATP** is a molecule that serves as the **primary energy currency of the cell**.  
It stores and transfers energy needed for biochemical processes, powering life at the molecular level.

## 🕰️ History / Origins
- Discovered in **1929** by German biochemist **Karl Lohmann**.  
- Its role as an energy carrier was established in the **1930s–1940s**.  
- Later research revealed ATP’s central role in metabolism and cellular respiration.

## 🔑 Key Features
- 🧬 **Structure**:  
  - Adenine (nitrogenous base).  
  - Ribose (sugar).  
  - Three phosphate groups (triphosphate chain).  
- ⚡ **Function**:  
  - Provides energy by breaking the bond of the terminal phosphate group (ATP → ADP + Pi).  
  - Powers muscle contraction, nerve impulses, biosynthesis, and active transport.  
- 🔄 **Cycle**:  
  - ATP is continuously regenerated from ADP during cellular respiration (glycolysis, Krebs cycle, oxidative phosphorylation).  
- 📍 **Location**: Found in all living cells, especially abundant in mitochondria.

## 🌍 Legacy / Impact
- ATP is essential for **life processes** — without it, cells cannot function.  
- Understanding ATP has advanced medicine, sports science, and biochemistry.  
- Central to research in metabolism, energy disorders, and bioengineering.

## 🌟 Fun Fact
Your body recycles its entire weight in ATP molecules **every single day** — that’s billions of ATP molecules being used and regenerated each second!
