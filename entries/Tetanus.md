## Introduction
**Tetanus** is a potentially life‑threatening disease caused by the bacterium *Clostridium tetani*. The bacteria release a toxin (*tetanospasmin*) that interferes with the nervous system, causing severe muscle contractions and spasms.

## History / Origins
- Known since antiquity, often linked to wounds contaminated with soil or rusted metal.  
- The name comes from the Greek *tetanos*, meaning “stretched” or “rigid.”  
- Widespread vaccination programs in the 20th century drastically reduced cases worldwide.  

## Key Features
- **Symptoms**: Jaw cramping (*lockjaw*), difficulty swallowing, muscle stiffness, seizures, fever, sweating, and spasms.  
- **Onset**: Usually 3–21 days after infection.  
- **Causes**: Bacteria enter through cuts, puncture wounds, burns, or animal bites.  
- **Risk Factors**: Unvaccinated individuals, contaminated wounds, poor wound care.  
- **Treatment**: Tetanus immune globulin (TIG), muscle relaxants, antibiotics, and supportive care.  
- **Prevention**: Vaccination (DTaP, Tdap, or Td boosters).  

## Legacy / Impact
- Still causes thousands of deaths annually, especially in regions with low vaccination coverage.  
- Neonatal tetanus remains a concern in areas with poor maternal healthcare.  
- Considered a “silent threat” because it is not contagious but deadly if untreated.  

## Fun Fact 🌟
It isn’t the *rust* on nails that causes tetanus — it’s the bacteria in soil that may contaminate wounds.
