The Paris Peace Settlement of 1919 was a series of treaties negotiated after World War I to reshape Europe and establish a new international order. The most significant of these was the Treaty of Versailles, which imposed strict terms on Germany and sought to prevent future conflict.

## Background

- World War I ended with the Armistice of November 11, 1918.  
- The Allied Powers convened in Paris in January 1919 to determine peace terms.  
- The "Big Four" leaders — Woodrow Wilson (USA), David Lloyd George (UK), Georges Clemenceau (France), and Vittorio Orlando (Italy) — dominated negotiations.  

## Major Treaties

1. **Treaty of Versailles (Germany)** – Signed June 28, 1919  
   - War guilt clause (Article 231)  
   - Reparations imposed on Germany  
   - Territorial losses: Alsace‑Lorraine to France, Polish Corridor, Saar under League control  
   - Military restrictions: army limited to 100,000, no air force, navy reduced  

2. **Treaty of Saint‑Germain (Austria)** – September 1919  
   - Dissolution of Austro‑Hungarian Empire  
   - Recognition of new states (Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia)  

3. **Treaty of Trianon (Hungary)** – June 1920  
   - Significant territorial losses to Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia  

4. **Treaty of Neuilly (Bulgaria)** – November 1919  
   - Loss of territory to Greece, Romania, and Yugoslavia  

5. **Treaty of Sèvres (Ottoman Empire)** – August 1920  
   - Partition of Ottoman lands; later revised by Treaty of Lausanne (1923)  

## Key Principles

- **Self‑determination**: Inspired by Wilson’s Fourteen Points, though inconsistently applied.  
- **League of Nations**: Established to promote collective security and prevent future wars.  
- **Reparations and Punishment**: Heavy burdens placed on Central Powers, especially Germany.  

## Immediate Effects on Europe

* Collapse of empires: German, Austro‑Hungarian, Ottoman, and Russian empires dissolved.  
* Creation of new states: Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Baltic nations.  
* Economic hardship: Reparations and territorial losses destabilized Germany and Central Europe.  
* Political instability: Rise of nationalist and extremist movements.  

## Long‑Term Consequences

- **Resentment in Germany**: Treaty of Versailles seen as a "Diktat," fueling nationalist anger.  
- **Weakness of the League of Nations**: Lacked enforcement power, undermining collective security.  
- **Border disputes**: Ethnic minorities in new states created tensions.  
- **Prelude to World War II**: Harsh terms and unresolved grievances contributed to instability.
