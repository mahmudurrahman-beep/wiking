The **Israel–Palestine conflict** is one of the world’s longest and most complex disputes, rooted in competing national, territorial, and religious claims. Resolution efforts have focused on a two‑state solution, but settlement expansion, violence, and political divisions continue to block progress.

## Historical Background

- **Late 19th–Early 20th Century** – Jewish immigration to Palestine increased under Ottoman and later British rule.  
- **1917 Balfour Declaration** – Britain expressed support for a Jewish homeland in Palestine, sparking tensions with the Arab majority.  
- **1947 UN Partition Plan** – Proposed separate Jewish and Arab states; accepted by Jews, rejected by Arabs.  
- **1948 Arab–Israeli War** – Israel declared independence; hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were displaced (*Nakba*).  
- **1967 Six‑Day War** – Israel occupied the West Bank, Gaza, East Jerusalem, and Golan Heights, intensifying disputes.  

## Current Situation

- **Territories** – Israel controls much of the West Bank; Gaza is governed by Hamas.  
- **Settlements** – Expansion of Israeli settlements in the West Bank continues.  
- **Annexation Concerns** – De facto annexation threatens Palestinian rights and regional stability.  
- **Violence** – Cycles of rocket attacks, military operations, and civilian casualties persist, especially in Gaza.  
- **International Law** – UN resolutions and ICJ advisory opinions highlight obligations in occupied territories.  

## Resolution Efforts

- **Two‑State Solution** – Widely supported internationally; envisions Israel and Palestine as independent states side by side.  
- **One‑State Solution** – Advocated by some, but controversial due to demographic and political challenges.  
- **Peace Accords** – Oslo Accords (1990s) created limited Palestinian self‑rule but failed to resolve core issues.  
- **Grassroots Movements** – Groups like *Combatants for Peace* promote non‑violent activism and dialogue.  
- **International Mediation** – U.S., EU, and Arab states have attempted to broker peace, but mistrust remains.  

## Key Obstacles

- **Jerusalem** – Both sides claim it as their capital.  
- **Refugees** – Millions of Palestinians displaced since 1948 seek recognition and return.  
- **Security** – Israel demands guarantees against terrorism; Palestinians demand freedom from occupation.  
- **Settlements** – Expansion undermines territorial continuity for a future Palestinian state.  

## Path Forward

- **Ceasefires and Confidence‑Building** – Short‑term steps to reduce violence.  
- **International Pressure** – UN resolutions and global diplomacy push for compliance with humanitarian law.  
- **Civil Society Initiatives** – Dialogue and cooperation at grassroots levels may build trust.  
- **Regional Integration** – Linking peace efforts to broader Middle East cooperation (e.g., Abraham Accords).  

---

*The Israel–Palestine conflict remains unresolved due to deep historical grievances, territorial disputes, and political divisions. While the two‑state solution is the most widely endorsed framework, settlement expansion and cycles of violence continue to block progress. Grassroots peace movements and international law offer pathways, but lasting resolution requires political will from both sides and sustained global engagement.*
