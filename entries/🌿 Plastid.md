## 📖 Introduction
**Plastids** are double‑membrane organelles found in the cells of plants and algae.  
They are responsible for essential functions such as **photosynthesis, storage, and pigment synthesis**.  
Plastids are highly versatile and can differentiate into various forms depending on the cell’s needs.

## 🕰️ History / Origins
- First described in the **19th century** by scientists studying plant cell structures.  
- The term *plastid* comes from the Greek word *plastos*, meaning “formed” or “molded.”  
- Their evolutionary origin is explained by the **endosymbiotic theory**, which suggests plastids evolved from cyanobacteria engulfed by ancestral eukaryotic cells.

## 🔑 Key Features
- 🧬 **Structure**:  
  - Surrounded by a double membrane.  
  - Contains its own DNA and ribosomes, enabling partial autonomy.  
- 🌱 **Types of Plastids**:  
  - **Chloroplasts**: Carry out photosynthesis, contain chlorophyll.  
  - **Chromoplasts**: Produce and store pigments (e.g., carotenoids in fruits/flowers).  
  - **Leucoplasts**: Colorless plastids specialized in storage (starch, oils, proteins).  
  - **Amyloplasts**: Store starch.  
  - **Elaioplasts**: Store lipids.  
  - **Proteinoplasts**: Store proteins.  
- 🔄 **Functions**:  
  - Photosynthesis.  
  - Pigment synthesis and storage.  
  - Energy and nutrient storage.  
  - Biosynthesis of fatty acids and amino acids.

## 🌍 Legacy / Impact
- Plastids are central to **plant life and ecosystems**, enabling photosynthesis and food production.  
- Critical in agriculture, biotechnology, and food science.  
- Their study has advanced understanding of **evolution, genetics, and bioengineering**.

## 🌟 Fun Fact
Banana fruits turn yellow as **chloroplasts transform into chromoplasts**, changing their pigment composition during ripening!
