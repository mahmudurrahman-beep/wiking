# 🧱 Fall of the Berlin Wall (1989)

## 📖 Introduction
The **Berlin Wall** was built in **1961** by the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) to prevent citizens from fleeing to West Berlin.  
For nearly three decades, it stood as the most powerful symbol of the **Cold War division** between East and West.  
Its fall in **November 1989** marked the beginning of German reunification and the collapse of communist regimes across Eastern Europe.

## 🕰️ Timeline

- **9 November 1989**: East German government announces relaxed travel restrictions; crowds gather and begin dismantling the Wall.  
- **3 October 1990**: Official reunification of Germany.

## 🔑 Causes of the Fall

- **Economic Strain**: East Germany’s stagnating economy compared to West Germany’s prosperity.

## 🌍 Consequences

- **Global Symbol**: The Wall’s destruction became a universal image of freedom and unity.

## ⚖️ Strategic Significance
- The Wall’s fall showed the limits of **compellence** (forcing people to stay) and the power of **deterrence** failing when public will demanded change.  
- It highlighted how **popular movements** and international pressure can reshape geopolitics without large‑scale war.
