## 📖 Introduction
India’s security doctrine has evolved significantly in the 21st century.  
While earlier policies emphasized **strategic restraint**, recent doctrines stress **active deterrence, sovereignty, and decisive retaliation** against terrorism and external threats.

## 🕰️ Evolution
- **1947–1971**: Focus on territorial integrity and conventional defense.  
- **1990s**: Rise of cross‑border terrorism, especially in Kashmir.  
- **2001–2016**: “Strategic restraint” — calibrated responses to terror attacks.  
- **2016 (Uri attack)**: India conducted “surgical strikes,” signaling a doctrinal shift.  
- **2019 (Pulwama/Balakot)**: Airstrikes deep inside Pakistan marked escalation.  
- **2025 (Pahalgam massacre)**: India unveiled a **new doctrine of zero tolerance**, treating terror attacks as acts of armed aggression.

## 🔑 Core Pillars (2025 Doctrine)
1. **Decisive Retaliation**  
   - Any terror attack traced to cross‑border groups will be met with strikes at their roots.  
   - Example: Operation Sindoor targeted multiple terror hubs in Pakistan and Pakistan‑administered Kashmir.

2. **Zero Tolerance**  
   - Terrorism is treated as an existential threat, not a law‑and‑order issue.  
   - No distinction between “good” and “bad” militants.

3. **Sovereignty as First Line of Defense**  
   - India asserts that its sovereignty is inviolable, rejecting external interference.  
   - Seen in responses to both Pakistan‑based terrorism and global crises.

4. **Multi‑Dimensional Approach**  
   - Military, diplomatic, economic, and political tools combined.  
   - Reflects the “Modi Doctrine” of comprehensive national security.

| Era/Doctrine        | Approach              | Example Actions                  | Outcome |
|---------------------|----------------------|----------------------------------|---------|
| **Pre‑2016**        | Strategic restraint   | Limited responses to terror      | Terror persisted |
| **2016–2019**       | Calibrated escalation | Surgical strikes, Balakot airstrikes | Raised deterrence |
| **2025 Doctrine**   | Zero tolerance, decisive retaliation | Operation Sindoor, strikes on terror hubs | Assertive deterrence |

## 🌍 Strategic Importance
- Positions India as a **regional power unwilling to tolerate cross‑border terrorism**.  
- Signals to Pakistan and global actors that India will act unilaterally if necessary.  
- Strengthens India’s credibility in global counterterrorism efforts.

## 🌟 Fun Fact
India’s new doctrine is sometimes called the **“New Normal”**, reflecting a mindset shift from restraint to proactive deterrence.
