## Introduction
**Los Alamos** is a town in northern New Mexico, United States, best known as the site of the **Manhattan Project**, where the first atomic bombs were developed during World War II. Today, it is home to the **Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL)**, one of the largest scientific research institutions in the world.

## History / Origins
- In **1943**, the U.S. government established a secret laboratory at Los Alamos to design and build nuclear weapons.  
- Directed by physicist **J. Robert Oppenheimer**, the lab brought together leading scientists including Enrico Fermi, Richard Feynman, and Edward Teller.  
- The project culminated in the creation of the bombs dropped on **Hiroshima** and **Nagasaki** in August 1945.  
- After the war, Los Alamos continued as a center for nuclear research and national security.  

## Key Features
- **Location**: Northern New Mexico, on the Pajarito Plateau.  
- **Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL)**: Focuses on nuclear science, national security, renewable energy, and advanced computing.  
- **Population**: Around 13,000 residents in the town, with thousands more working at the lab.  
- **Secrecy**: During WWII, Los Alamos was a closed city; workers and families lived under strict security.  

## Legacy / Impact
- Played a pivotal role in ending World War II and shaping the nuclear age.  
- Continues to be a hub for cutting‑edge science, including supercomputing, space exploration, and bioscience.  
- Symbolizes both the power and ethical dilemmas of nuclear technology.  

## Fun Fact 🌟
During the Manhattan Project, Los Alamos was so secret that its mailing address was simply **“P.O. Box 1663, Santa Fe, New Mexico.”**
