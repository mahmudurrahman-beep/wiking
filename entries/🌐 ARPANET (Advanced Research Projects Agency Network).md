## 📖 Introduction
**ARPANET** was the first operational packet‑switching network and the precursor to the modern Internet.  
It was developed to connect research institutions and enable secure communication during the Cold War.

## 🕰️ History / Origins
- **1966**: Project initiated by ARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency).  
- **1969**: First successful connection between UCLA and Stanford Research Institute.  
- **1970s**: Expanded to universities and research labs across the U.S. and abroad.  
- **1983**: Transitioned to the **TCP/IP protocol suite**, officially creating the Internet.  
- **1990**: ARPANET was decommissioned, replaced by modern networks.  

## 🔑 Key Features
- 📡 **Packet Switching**: Messages broken into packets for efficient transfer.  
- 🖥️ **Nodes**: Early sites included UCLA, Stanford, UC Santa Barbara, and the University of Utah.  
- 🔐 **Protocols**: Initially used NCP (Network Control Protocol), later replaced by TCP/IP.  
- 🌍 **Global Reach**: Connected to institutions in the UK and Norway by the mid‑1970s.  

## 🌍 Legacy / Impact
- Laid the **technical foundation of the Internet**.  
- Introduced concepts of distributed networking and resilience against failures.  
- Influenced computing, communication, and global information exchange.  
- Sparked innovations in email, file transfer, and remote login.  

## 🌟 Fun Fact
The very first ARPANET message sent on **October 29, 1969** was supposed to be “LOGIN” — but the system crashed after just two letters, transmitting only **“LO”**!
