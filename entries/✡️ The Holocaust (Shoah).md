# ✡️ The Holocaust (Shoah)

## 📖 Introduction
The **Holocaust** (Hebrew: *Shoah*) was the systematic, state‑sponsored persecution and murder of six million Jews by Nazi Germany and its collaborators during **World War II (1941–1945)**.  
Other targeted groups included Roma (Gypsies), people with disabilities, Poles, Soviet prisoners of war, and others deemed “undesirable” by the Nazi regime.

## ⚖️ Deterrence Connection
The Holocaust demonstrates the catastrophic failure of deterrence when a regime is driven by ideology and unchecked power.  
It also shaped postwar policies to prevent future genocides through international law and collective security.

## 🌟 Fun Fact
The word *Holocaust* comes from the Greek *holokaustos*, meaning “completely burned,” while the Hebrew term *Shoah* means “catastrophe.”
