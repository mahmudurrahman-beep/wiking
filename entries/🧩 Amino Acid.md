## 📖 Introduction
**Amino acids** are organic compounds that serve as the building blocks of proteins.  
They play critical roles in metabolism, growth, repair, and communication within living organisms.

## 🕰️ History / Origins
- First discovered in the **19th century** during studies of protein chemistry.  
- The term "amino acid" refers to molecules containing both an **amine group (-NH2)** and a **carboxyl group (-COOH)**.  
- By the early 20th century, scientists identified the essential amino acids required for human health.

## 🔑 Key Features
- 🧬 **Structure**: Central carbon atom bonded to:  
  - An amino group (-NH2).  
  - A carboxyl group (-COOH).  
  - A hydrogen atom.  
  - A variable side chain (R group) that defines the amino acid.  
- 🔢 **Types**:  
  - **Essential amino acids**: Must be obtained from diet (e.g., lysine, methionine).  
  - **Non‑essential amino acids**: Synthesized by the body (e.g., alanine, glutamine).  
- ⚡ **Functions**:  
  - Protein synthesis.  
  - Enzyme activity.  
  - Neurotransmitter production.  
  - Energy metabolism.  

## 🌍 Legacy / Impact
- Amino acids are vital for **nutrition, medicine, and biotechnology**.  
- Used in supplements, pharmaceuticals, and food science.  
- Research into amino acids has advanced understanding of **genetics, metabolism, and disease treatment**.  

## 🌟 Fun Fact
The human body uses **20 standard amino acids** to build proteins — but in nature, scientists have discovered **over 500 different amino acids**!
