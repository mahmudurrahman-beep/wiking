## 📖 Introduction
**Ribosomes** are molecular machines found in all living cells.  
They are responsible for **protein synthesis**, translating genetic instructions from messenger RNA (mRNA) into chains of amino acids.

## 🕰️ History / Origins
- First observed in the **1950s** using electron microscopy.  
- The term *ribosome* was coined in **1958** by scientist **Richard B. Roberts**.  
- Their structure and function were later clarified through advances in molecular biology and crystallography.

## 🔑 Key Features
- 🧬 **Structure**:  
  - Composed of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and proteins.  
  - Two subunits:  
    - Small subunit (reads mRNA).  
    - Large subunit (joins amino acids together).  
- 📍 **Location**:  
  - Free in the cytoplasm.  
  - Attached to the endoplasmic reticulum (forming rough ER).  
- ⚡ **Function**:  
  - Translate mRNA into polypeptide chains.  
  - Central to gene expression and protein production.  
- 🔄 **Types**:  
  - Prokaryotic ribosomes (70S).  
  - Eukaryotic ribosomes (80S).

## 🌍 Legacy / Impact
- Ribosomes are essential for **life**, as they produce proteins needed for structure, enzymes, and signaling.  
- Their study has advanced medicine, biotechnology, and understanding of antibiotics (many target bacterial ribosomes).  
- Ribosome research earned the **2009 Nobel Prize in Chemistry** for Ada Yonath, Venkatraman Ramakrishnan, and Thomas Steitz.

## 🌟 Fun Fact
Ribosomes are so busy that a single human cell can contain **up to 10 million ribosomes**, all working simultaneously to keep you alive!
