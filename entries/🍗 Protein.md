## 📖 Introduction
**Proteins** are large, complex molecules made up of chains of amino acids.  
They are essential for the structure, function, and regulation of the body’s cells, tissues, and organs.  
Proteins are often called the **“building blocks of life.”**

## 🕰️ History / Origins
- The term *protein* was coined in **1838** by Dutch chemist **Gerardus Johannes Mulder**, derived from the Greek word *proteios* meaning “primary” or “of first importance.”  
- Early studies revealed proteins as vital components of living organisms.  
- Modern biochemistry identified their role in enzymes, hormones, and structural tissues.

## 🔑 Key Features
- 🧩 **Structure**: Made of 20 different amino acids linked in chains.  
- 🏗️ **Levels of Structure**:  
  - Primary (sequence of amino acids).  
  - Secondary (alpha helices, beta sheets).  
  - Tertiary (3D folding).  
  - Quaternary (multiple chains together).  
- ⚡ **Functions**:  
  - Enzymes (catalysts for biochemical reactions).  
  - Structural (collagen, keratin).  
  - Transport (hemoglobin).  
  - Defense (antibodies).  
  - Regulation (hormones like insulin).  
- 🍳 **Sources**: Meat, fish, eggs, dairy, legumes, nuts, and seeds.

## 🌍 Legacy / Impact
- Proteins are essential for **growth, repair, and energy metabolism**.  
- Central to biotechnology, medicine, and nutrition.  
- Protein engineering and synthetic biology are advancing drug design and industrial applications.  

## 🌟 Fun Fact
Your body contains about **100,000 different proteins**, each with a unique role — from digesting food to fighting infections!
