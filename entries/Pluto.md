## Introduction
Pluto is a **dwarf planet** in the Kuiper Belt, located beyond Neptune. Once considered the ninth planet of the Solar System, it was reclassified in **2006** by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). Despite its small size, Pluto remains one of the most fascinating objects in planetary science.

## History / Origins
- Discovered in **1930** by Clyde Tombaugh at the Lowell Observatory.  
- Named after the Roman god of the underworld, suggested by an 11-year-old girl, Venetia Burney.  
- Initially hailed as the ninth planet, but later discoveries of similar-sized objects led to its reclassification.  

## Key Features
- Diameter: ~2,377 km (smaller than Earth’s Moon).  
- Orbit: Highly elliptical, taking **248 Earth years** to complete one revolution around the Sun.  
- Atmosphere: Thin, composed mainly of nitrogen, methane, and carbon monoxide.  
- Moons: Five known moons — **Charon** (largest), Styx, Nix, Kerberos, and Hydra.  
- Surface: Icy plains, mountains, and possible subsurface ocean.  

## Legacy / Impact
- The **New Horizons mission (2015)** provided the first close-up images of Pluto, revealing its complex geology.  
- Pluto’s reclassification sparked debate about what defines a planet.  
- Continues to be a symbol of scientific discovery and public fascination.  

## Fun Fact 🌟
Pluto and its largest moon **Charon** are so close in size that they actually form a **binary system**, orbiting a common center of gravity outside Pluto itself!
