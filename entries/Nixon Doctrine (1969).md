## 📖 Introduction
The **Nixon Doctrine** (also called the *Guam Doctrine*) was a major shift in U.S. foreign policy during the Cold War.  
It was first announced by President Nixon on **July 25, 1969**, during a press conference in Guam, and later formalized in his **Vietnamization speech** on November 3, 1969.

## 🕰️ Historical Context
- **Vietnam War**: Heavy U.S. involvement had become politically and economically unsustainable.  
- **Cold War pressures**: The U.S. sought to balance commitments without overextending military forces.  
- **Domestic concerns**: Rising opposition to the Vietnam War pushed Nixon to redefine America’s role abroad.

## 🔑 Core Principles
1. **Self-defense first**: Allies should provide the manpower for their own defense.  
2. **U.S. support**: America would provide economic and military aid when requested.  
3. **Nuclear umbrella**: The U.S. would continue to deter nuclear threats against allies.  
4. **Reduced direct intervention**: No more large-scale U.S. ground troop deployments like in Vietnam.

## 🌍 Strategic Importance
- Marked a **shift from direct intervention to indirect support**.  
- Encouraged allies (e.g., South Vietnam, South Korea, Iran) to strengthen their own militaries.  
- Reflected U.S. desire to contain communism without repeating Vietnam-style wars.  
- Influenced later policies of burden-sharing within NATO and U.S. alliances.

## ⚖️ Legacy
- Seen as a **pragmatic retrenchment** of U.S. commitments.  
- Criticized for leaving allies vulnerable (e.g., South Vietnam after U.S. withdrawal).  
- Still relevant in debates about U.S. military commitments and global strategy.

## 🌟 Fun Fact
The doctrine was nicknamed the **“Guam Doctrine”** because Nixon first announced it while stopping in Guam on his way to Asia.
