South Asia’s political and administrative evolution spans pre‑colonial empires, company rule, and the British Crown Raj, culminating in the partition and independence of India and Pakistan in 1947.

## Pre‑colonial Polities and Governance

- **Regional empires**: Maurya, Gupta, Chola, Delhi Sultanate, and Mughal Empire with centralized tax and land administration.  
- **Local institutions**: Village assemblies, zamindars, temple estates, and customary law.  
- **Princely autonomy**: Numerous kingdoms and confederacies later recognized as princely states under British paramountcy.  

## Company Rule and Early Colonial Administration (1757–1858)

1. **Territorial expansion**: East India Company extended control after the Battle of Plassey (1757).  
2. **Regulating Act (1773)** and **Pitt’s India Act (1784)** centralized oversight.  
3. **Revenue systems**:  
   - Permanent Settlement (1793) in Bengal.  
   - Ryotwari in Madras and Bombay.  
   - Mahalwari in North‑Western Provinces.  
4. **Infrastructure**: Railways, telegraph, postal services integrated administration.  

## Crown Raj and Imperial Restructuring (1858–1935)

- **Transfer to the Crown (1858)**: Authority shifted from Company to British Parliament after the 1857 uprising.  
- **Indian Civil Service (ICS)**: District collectors as administrative backbone.  
- **Councils and representation**:  
  - Indian Councils Acts (1861, 1892).  
  - Morley–Minto Reforms (1909).  
- **Montagu–Chelmsford Reforms (1919)**: Provincial diarchy introduced.  
- **Police, revenue, judiciary**: Codified law and district‑level administration consolidated imperial authority.  

## Government of India Act 1935 and Provincial Autonomy

1. **Constitutional redesign**: Proposed federation and provincial autonomy.  
2. **1937 elections**: Indian parties formed ministries in provinces.  
3. **Limits**: Governors retained discretionary powers; communal electorates deepened divisions.  

## Princely States and Paramountcy

- Over 560 princely states retained autonomy under British paramountcy.  
- Administrative diversity: Some modernized, others maintained traditional structures.  
- Their integration became a crucial issue before independence.  

## Nationalist Mobilization and Administrative Responses

- **Indian National Congress (1885)** and **All‑India Muslim League (1906)** organized mass politics.  
- **Key flashpoints**: Partition of Bengal (1905), Non‑Cooperation (1920–22), Civil Disobedience (1930–34), Quit India (1942).  
- Colonial authorities alternated between concessions (reforms) and coercion (laws).  

## The Road to 1947

- **World War II** weakened British control and legitimacy.  
- **Partition and independence (1947)** created India and Pakistan.  
- Colonial administrative structures (civil services, judiciary, police) provided continuity for new states.

*By 1947, South Asia inherited a complex administrative legacy: centralized bureaucracy, codified law, and modern infrastructure, alongside unresolved communal divisions and the challenge of integrating princely states.*
