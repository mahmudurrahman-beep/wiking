## 📖 Introduction
**Gregor Johann Mendel** (1822–1884) was an Austrian scientist and Augustinian friar, celebrated as the **“Father of Genetics.”**  
Through his experiments with pea plants, Mendel discovered the fundamental laws of inheritance that underpin modern biology.

## 🕰️ History / Origins
- **Born**: 20 July 1822, Heinzendorf bei Odrau (now Hynčice, Czech Republic).  
- Studied physics and natural sciences at the **University of Vienna**.  
- Became a friar and later abbot at **St. Thomas’ Abbey** in Brno.  
- Conducted pea plant experiments between **1856–1863**, publishing his findings in **1866**.  
- His work was overlooked during his lifetime but rediscovered around **1900**, sparking the birth of modern genetics.

## 🔑 Key Contributions
- **Mendel’s Laws of Inheritance**:  
  - **Law of Segregation** 🧩: Each organism carries two alleles for each trait, which separate during gamete formation.  
  - **Law of Independent Assortment** 🔄: Traits are inherited independently of one another.  
  - **Law of Dominance** 🌟: Some traits mask the presence of others.  
- Used **pea plants (Pisum sativum)** to study traits like flower color, seed shape, and plant height.  
- Introduced the concept of **hereditary units** (later called genes).

## 🌍 Legacy / Impact
- Mendel’s principles form the foundation of **genetics**.  
- Influenced biology, medicine, agriculture, and evolutionary theory.  
- Today, he is honored as one of the greatest pioneers in science.  

## 🌟 Fun Fact
Mendel’s results were so precise that modern statisticians have debated whether they were **“too perfect”** — sparking discussions about unconscious bias in his experiments!
