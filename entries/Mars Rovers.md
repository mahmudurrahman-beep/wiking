# Mars Rovers

## 📖 Introduction
A **Mars rover** is a remote‑controlled robotic vehicle built to travel across the Martian surface.  
Unlike stationary landers, rovers can **move to different sites**, conduct experiments, and survive longer by positioning themselves for sunlight and avoiding hazards.

## 🕰️ History / Origins
- **1997 – Sojourner**: First successful Mars rover, part of NASA’s Pathfinder mission.  
- **2004 – Spirit & Opportunity**: Twin rovers; Spirit lasted until 2010, Opportunity until 2018.  
- **2012 – Curiosity**: Still active, studying Mars’ climate and geology.  
- **2021 – Perseverance**: Searching for signs of ancient life in Jezero Crater; collecting samples for future return.  
- **2021 – Zhurong (China)**: First non‑NASA rover, operated until 2022.  

## 🔑 Key Features
- 🌍 **Mobility**: Can travel kilometers across terrain.  
- 🧪 **Science Payloads**: Cameras, spectrometers, drills, and chemical analyzers.  
- 📡 **Communication**: Relays data via orbiters back to Earth.  
- ☀️ **Power**: Solar panels (Sojourner, Spirit, Opportunity, Zhurong) or nuclear RTGs (Curiosity, Perseverance).  
- 🤖 **Autonomy**: Can navigate obstacles and plan routes with limited human input.  

## 🌍 Legacy / Impact
- Provided evidence of **water on Mars**.  
- Revealed Mars’ **climate history** and potential habitability.  
- Perseverance is preparing samples for **future return missions**.  
- Inspired public interest and advanced robotics for planetary exploration.  

## 🌟 Fun Fact
Opportunity’s mission was planned for **90 days** but lasted **15 years**, traveling over **45 km** across Mars.
