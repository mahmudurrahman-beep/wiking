## Definition
**Nuclear fusion** is a reaction in which two or more light atomic nuclei (such as hydrogen isotopes) combine to form a heavier nucleus. The difference in mass between the reactants and products is released as energy, according to Einstein’s equation \(E = mc^2\).

## How It Works
- Fusion occurs in a state of matter called **plasma**, a superheated gas of ions and electrons.  
- Requires extremely high **temperatures (millions of degrees)** and **pressures** to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between nuclei.  
- In stars, gravity provides the necessary pressure; on Earth, scientists use magnetic confinement (tokamaks) or inertial confinement (lasers).  

## Examples of Fusion Reactions
1. **Hydrogen Fusion in the Sun**  
   - \( ^1H + ^1H \rightarrow ^2H + e^+ + \nu_e \)  
   - Chains of reactions eventually produce helium and release energy.  

2. **Deuterium–Tritium Fusion (D–T Reaction)**  
   - \( ^2H + ^3H \rightarrow ^4He + n + 17.6 \, MeV \)  
   - Most promising for terrestrial fusion power.  

## Applications
- **Energy Production** – Fusion promises clean, abundant energy with minimal radioactive waste.  
- **Weapons** – Thermonuclear (hydrogen) bombs use fusion reactions triggered by fission.  
- **Astrophysics** – Fusion drives stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis of heavier elements.  

## Advantages
- Virtually limitless fuel (hydrogen isotopes from water).  
- No greenhouse gas emissions during operation.  
- Produces less long‑lived radioactive waste compared to fission.  

## Challenges
- Achieving sustained **net energy gain** (more energy out than in).  
- Containing plasma at extreme temperatures.  
- High cost and complexity of experimental reactors.  

## Current Research
- **ITER (France)** – International tokamak project aiming for sustained fusion power.  
- **NIF (USA)** – Laser‑based inertial confinement experiments achieved ignition in 2022.  
- **China’s EAST Tokamak** – Reached plasma temperatures over 100 million °C.
