# Pangaea

## 📖 Introduction
**Pangaea** (Greek for “all Earth”) was a supercontinent that existed during the **late Paleozoic and early Mesozoic eras**.  
It was surrounded by the global ocean **Panthalassa** and the **Tethys Ocean**.

## 🕰️ Timeline
- **335 million years ago**: Pangaea begins to form from Gondwana, Euramerica, and Siberia.  
- **250 million years ago**: Fully assembled, stretching across both poles.  
- **200 million years ago**: Begins breaking apart during the Triassic/Jurassic periods.  
- **175 million years ago**: Splits into **Laurasia** (north) and **Gondwana** (south).  

## 🔑 Key Features
- 🌍 **Shape**: C‑shaped, spanning pole to pole.  
- 🌊 **Surroundings**: Encircled by Panthalassa, the “superocean.”  
- 🦖 **Life**: Dinosaurs and early reptiles roamed across connected ecosystems.  
- 🧭 **Discovery**: Concept proposed by Alfred Wegener in 1912 as part of **continental drift theory**.  

## 🌍 Legacy / Impact
- Pangaea’s breakup explains today’s **continental drift** and plate tectonics.  
- Fossil evidence across continents supports its existence (e.g., Mesosaurus fossils in both South America and Africa).  
- Influences modern geology, paleontology, and climate science.  

## 🌟 Fun Fact
Future tectonic movement may create another supercontinent in ~250 million years, sometimes called **Pangaea Proxima**.
