# Angioplasty

## 📖 What It Is
Angioplasty is a medical procedure performed by interventional cardiologists or radiologists to treat **arterial atherosclerosis** (plaque buildup inside arteries).  
It is commonly used for **coronary arteries** (heart blood vessels), but can also be applied to other arteries in the body.

## 🕰️ How It Works
1. A catheter with a deflated balloon is inserted into the narrowed artery.  
2. The balloon is inflated, pressing plaque against the artery walls.  
3. Blood flow improves as the artery widens.  
4. A **stent** may be placed to keep the artery open after balloon inflation.  
5. The balloon is deflated and removed.  

## 🔑 Types
- **Coronary Angioplasty**: For heart arteries.  
- **Peripheral Angioplasty**: For arteries in legs, arms, or other regions.  
- **Carotid Angioplasty**: For arteries supplying the brain.  

## 🌍 Benefits
- Restores blood flow to vital organs.  
- Reduces chest pain (angina) and risk of heart attack.  
- Minimally invasive compared to open surgery.  
- Shorter hospital stay and faster recovery.  

## ⚠️ Risks & Considerations
- Artery re‑narrowing (restenosis).  
- Blood clots forming around the stent.  
- Bleeding or infection at the catheter insertion site.  
- Rare complications: heart attack, stroke, or vessel damage.  

## 🌟 Recovery
- Many patients go home the same day or after one night in hospital.  
- Lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, quitting smoking) are essential to prevent future blockages.  
- Medications (like blood thinners) are often prescribed to keep stents open.
