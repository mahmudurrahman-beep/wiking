# Strategic Narcissism

## 📖 Introduction
**Strategic Narcissism** is a term popularized by retired U.S. General **H.R. McMaster** to describe a flawed approach to foreign policy.  
It occurs when a nation assumes that global events revolve around its own actions and interests, ignoring the independent motivations of other actors.

## 🔑 Core Idea
- **Definition**: Viewing the world primarily through one’s own lens, assuming adversaries act only in response to U.S. policies.  
- **Problem**: Leads to misjudging threats, underestimating adversaries, and crafting unrealistic strategies.  
- **Contrast**: Opposite of **Strategic Empathy**, which emphasizes understanding others’ perspectives and histories.

## 🕰️ Context
- McMaster introduced the concept in speeches and his book *Battlegrounds: The Fight to Defend the Free World* (2020).  
- He argued that U.S. foreign policy after the Cold War often fell into strategic narcissism, assuming American power alone could shape outcomes.  
- Examples include missteps in Iraq, Afghanistan, and relations with China and Russia.

## 🌍 Consequences
- **Policy Failures**: Overconfidence in military interventions without accounting for local dynamics.  
- **Misinterpretation**: Viewing adversaries’ actions as mere reactions, rather than independent strategies.  
- **Global Impact**: Weakens deterrence, damages credibility, and fosters instability.

## ⚖️ Strategic Narcissism vs. Strategic Empathy
- **Strategic Narcissism**: “The world revolves around us.”  
- **Strategic Empathy**: “Understand others on their own terms.”  
- McMaster argues that empathy is essential for realistic deterrence and effective diplomacy, while narcissism leads to blind spots.

## 🌟 Fun Fact
McMaster often describes strategic narcissism as a kind of **mirror‑gazing**, where policymakers see only themselves reflected in global events.
