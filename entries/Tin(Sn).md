## Introduction
**Tin** is a chemical element with the symbol **Sn** (from Latin *stannum*) and atomic number **50**. It is a silvery‑white metal known for its malleability, resistance to corrosion, and use in alloys such as bronze.

## History / Origins
- Used by humans since antiquity, especially in combination with copper to make **bronze** (Bronze Age, ~3300 BCE).  
- Ancient civilizations in Mesopotamia, Egypt, and China mined and traded tin.  
- The word *tin* comes from Old English, while *stannum* was used in Latin.  

## Key Features
- **Appearance**: Soft, silvery‑white metal.  
- **Properties**: Malleable, ductile, resistant to corrosion, low melting point (232 °C).  
- **Occurrence**: Found mainly in the mineral **cassiterite (SnO₂)**.  
- **Uses**:  
  - Alloying with copper to make **bronze**.  
  - Coating other metals (tin plating) to prevent rust.  
  - Used in solder, pewter, and bearings.  
  - Modern applications include electronics and lithium‑ion batteries.  

## Legacy / Impact
- Central to the **Bronze Age**, enabling stronger tools and weapons.  
- Important in global trade, with tin mines in Cornwall (UK), Southeast Asia, and South America.  
- Still widely used in industry, though less common than iron, aluminum, or copper.  

## Fun Fact 🌟
When bent, tin produces a distinctive “tin cry” — a crackling sound caused by the breaking of crystal structures.
