## What It Is
- A **second-generation nuclear weapon** that relies on **nuclear fusion** (combining light atoms like hydrogen) instead of just fission (splitting heavy atoms).  
- Uses a **two-stage design**:  
  1. **Fission trigger** (like an atomic bomb) creates extreme heat and pressure.  
  2. **Fusion stage** ignites hydrogen isotopes (deuterium, tritium), producing massive energy.  

## Difference from Atomic Bomb
- **Atomic bomb:** Uses fission of uranium or plutonium.  
- **Hydrogen bomb:** Uses fusion, triggered by a fission explosion.  
- **Power:** Hydrogen bombs can be **20–1000 times more powerful** than atomic bombs[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://nuclear-energy.net/applications/nuclear-weapons/hydrogen-bomb?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054&citationId=2&citationId=3 "Britannica").  

## History
- First tested by the **United States in 1952** (*Ivy Mike* test).  
- The **Soviet Union tested its own in 1953**.  
- Other nuclear powers (UK, France, China) later developed them.  
- The largest ever: **Tsar Bomba (1961)** by the USSR, yield ~50 megatons.  

## Effects
- **Blast:** Can destroy entire cities.  
- **Radiation:** Releases intense fallout, though fusion itself produces less radioactive waste than fission.  
- **Climate impact:** Large-scale use could trigger “**nuclear winter**.”  

## Risks & Legacy
- Considered the **most destructive weapon ever created**.  
- Central to Cold War nuclear deterrence.  
- Still part of modern nuclear arsenals, though never used in war.
