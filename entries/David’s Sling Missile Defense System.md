## 📖 Introduction
**David’s Sling** is part of Israel’s multi‑layered missile defense architecture.  
It complements **Iron Dome** (short‑range) and **Arrow** (long‑range) systems, providing a **middle tier** defense against diverse aerial threats.

## 🕰️ Development & Service
- **2009**: Jointly developed by Rafael (Israel) and Raytheon (U.S.).  
- **2015**: Successful test launches of the Stunner interceptor.  
- **2017**: Entered service with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).  
- **2025**: Upgraded system completed advanced live‑fire tests, enhancing capabilities against evolving threats.

## 🔑 Technical Characteristics
- **Interceptor**: Stunner missile.  
- **Range**: Up to 300 km (190 mi).  
- **Speed**: Mach 7.5.  
- **Guidance**: AESA radar, dual electro‑optical seekers, real‑time datalink.  
- **Kill Mechanism**: Hit‑to‑kill (kinetic impact).  
- **Propulsion**: Two‑stage solid rocket motor.  
- **Cost per missile**: Approx. $700,000.

## 🌍 Strategic Role
- Protects against **short‑range ballistic missiles**, **large rockets**, and **cruise missiles**.  
- Provides coverage where Iron Dome is insufficient and Arrow is excessive.  
- Enhances Israel’s layered defense strategy, ensuring resilience against regional threats.  
- Co‑development with the U.S. strengthens defense cooperation.
