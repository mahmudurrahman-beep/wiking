In ancient Greece, the **city-state (polis)** was the basic political, social, and cultural unit. Each polis consisted of an urban center and its surrounding countryside, functioning independently with its own laws, military, and traditions.

## Origins and Structure

- Emerged around the 8th century BCE.  
- Each polis had an **acropolis** (fortified hilltop) and an **agora** (marketplace and civic center).  
- Citizens participated in governance, though rights varied by city.  
- Shared language, religion, and customs linked the poleis, but they often competed or fought wars.
