# ✈️ Wright Brothers

## 📖 Introduction
The **Wright brothers** — **Orville (1871–1948)** and **Wilbur (1867–1912)** — were self‑taught engineers and inventors from Dayton, Ohio.  
They are best known for inventing, building, and flying the **Wright Flyer**, the first successful heavier‑than‑air powered aircraft.

## 🕰️ Timeline
- **1899–1902**: Conducted glider experiments to master flight control.  
- **17 December 1903**: Achieved the first powered, sustained, and controlled flight at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina.  
- **1905**: Built the Wright Flyer III, capable of practical flight.  
- **1909**: Formed the Wright Company to manufacture airplanes.  
- **1912**: Wilbur Wright dies of typhoid fever.  
- **1948**: Orville Wright dies, having seen aviation evolve into jet aircraft.

## 🔑 Innovations
- **Three‑axis control system**: Allowed pilots to steer and maintain equilibrium.  
- **Propeller design**: Efficiently converted engine power into thrust.  
- **Wind tunnel testing**: Pioneered scientific methods in aeronautical engineering.  
- **Practical aircraft**: Transitioned from experimental gliders to fully functional airplanes.

## 🌍 Legacy
- Revolutionized transportation and warfare.  
- Inspired the rapid development of aviation technology in the 20th century.  
- Their invention laid the foundation for modern aerospace engineering.  
- Honored worldwide, including the **Wright Brothers National Memorial** at Kitty Hawk.

## 🌟 Fun Fact
The first flight on **December 17, 1903** lasted only **12 seconds** and covered **120 feet** — yet it changed history forever.
