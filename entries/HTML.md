# HTML (HyperText Markup Language)

**HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** is the standard markup language used to create and structure content on the **World Wide Web**. It defines the meaning and structure of web documents, allowing browsers to render text, images, links, and interactive elements.

## History
- Developed by **Tim Berners-Lee** in **1991** at CERN as part of the first web browser and server.  
- **HTML 2.0 (1995):** First standardized version by the IETF.  
- **HTML 4.01 (1999):** Introduced support for stylesheets and scripting.  
- **XHTML (2000s):** Reformulated HTML as XML.  
- **HTML5 (2014):** Modern standard maintained by the **W3C** and **WHATWG**, adding multimedia, semantic elements, and APIs.  

## Structure
HTML documents are composed of **elements** represented by tags:
- `<html>` – root element.  
- `<head>` – metadata, title, links to stylesheets/scripts.  
- `<body>` – visible content of the page.  

### Example
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My First Page</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
  <p>This is my first HTML paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>
