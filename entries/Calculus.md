## Introduction
**Calculus** is the mathematical study of continuous change, much like geometry studies shape and algebra studies operations. It is central to modern mathematics and science, providing tools to analyze motion, growth, and physical systems.

## History / Origins
- Developed independently in the 17th century by **Isaac Newton** and **Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz**.  
- Newton focused on physics applications, while Leibniz emphasized notation and formalism.  
- Their work unified earlier ideas of limits, tangents, and areas into a systematic discipline.  

## Key Features
- **Differential Calculus**: Studies rates of change, slopes of curves, and instantaneous velocity.  
- **Integral Calculus**: Studies accumulation, areas under curves, and total quantities.  
- **Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**: Connects differentiation and integration.  
- Applications: Physics, engineering, economics, biology, computer science, and more.  

## Legacy / Impact
- Essential for modeling real-world phenomena such as planetary motion, population growth, and optimization problems.  
- Forms the basis of advanced fields like differential equations, multivariable calculus, and vector analysis.  
- Continues to be a cornerstone of education in mathematics and science worldwide.  

## Fun Fact 🌟
The word **“calculus”** comes from the Latin for **“small stone”**, since stones were used for counting in ancient times!
