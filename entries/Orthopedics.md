# Orthopedics

## 📖 Introduction
**Orthopedics** (or **orthopaedics**) is the branch of medicine focused on the **musculoskeletal system** — bones, joints, ligaments, tendons, and muscles.  
Orthopedic specialists diagnose, treat, and perform surgery for injuries, deformities, and diseases affecting movement and stability.

## 🕰️ History
- Originates from the Greek words *orthos* (“straight”) and *paideia* (“child rearing”).  
- First described in 1741 by Nicolas Andry, who emphasized correcting deformities in children.  
- Modern orthopedics expanded to include trauma care, joint replacement, and sports medicine.

## 🔑 Areas of Care
- **Fractures & Trauma**: Bone breaks, dislocations, and accident injuries.  
- **Joint Replacement**: Hip, knee, and shoulder prosthetics.  
- **Spine Surgery**: Disc problems, scoliosis, spinal fusion.  
- **Sports Injuries**: Ligament tears, cartilage repair, arthroscopy.  
- **Pediatric Orthopedics**: Congenital deformities like clubfoot.  
- **Hand & Foot Surgery**: Carpal tunnel, bunions, limb corrections.

## 🌍 Benefits
- Restores mobility and independence.  
- Relieves chronic pain (e.g., arthritis).  
- Prevents long‑term disability.  
- Improves quality of life after injury or disease.

## ⚠️ Risks & Considerations
- Infection at surgical site.  
- Blood clots after major surgery.  
- Implant wear or loosening over time.  
- Rehabilitation and physiotherapy often required.

## 🌟 Fun Fact
Orthopedic surgeons often work closely with **physiotherapists** to ensure patients regain strength and flexibility after surgery.
