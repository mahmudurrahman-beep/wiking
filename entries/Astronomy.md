## Definition
**Astronomy** is the scientific study of celestial objects, space, and the universe as a whole. It explores the origins, evolution, and physical properties of stars, planets, galaxies, and cosmic phenomena.

## Branches of Astronomy
1. **Observational Astronomy**  
   - Uses telescopes and instruments to observe celestial bodies.  
   - Includes optical, radio, infrared, X‑ray, and gamma‑ray astronomy.  

2. **Theoretical Astronomy**  
   - Uses mathematics and physics to explain observations.  
   - Develops models of stellar evolution, galaxy formation, and cosmology.  

3. **Astrophysics**  
   - Focuses on the physical processes of celestial objects.  
   - Studies gravity, radiation, nuclear fusion, and relativity.  

4. **Cosmology**  
   - Examines the origin, structure, and fate of the universe.  
   - Includes theories like the Big Bang and dark matter/energy.  

5. **Planetary Science**  
   - Studies planets, moons, asteroids, and comets.  
   - Includes comparative planetology and exoplanet research.  

## Tools and Methods
- **Telescopes** – Optical, radio, and space‑based (e.g., Hubble, James Webb).  
- **Spectroscopy** – Analyzes light to determine composition and motion.  
- **Space Missions** – Satellites, probes, and rovers explore planets and beyond.  
- **Computational Models** – Simulate cosmic phenomena.  

## Importance
- Expands knowledge of the universe and humanity’s place in it.  
- Drives technological innovation (e.g., imaging, computing).  
- Inspires philosophy, culture, and exploration.  
- Provides practical benefits like satellite navigation and climate monitoring.  

## Fun Facts
- Light from the Sun takes about **8 minutes** to reach Earth.  
- The Milky Way contains over **100 billion stars**.  
- The universe is estimated to be **13.8 billion years old**.  
- Black holes can warp space and time around them.
