# ⚔️ Korean War (1950–1953)

## 📖 Introduction
The **Korean War** was the first major armed conflict of the **Cold War**, fought on the Korean Peninsula between **North Korea (DPRK)** and **South Korea (ROK)**, with heavy involvement from global powers.  
It remains technically unresolved, as no peace treaty was signed — only an armistice.

## 🕰️ Timeline

- **July 1950**: U.S. and UN forces intervened to support South Korea.  
- **October 1950**: UN forces advanced toward the Yalu River; China entered the war to aid North Korea.  
- **1951–1953**: Stalemate around the 38th parallel, heavy fighting but little territorial change.  
- **27 July 1953**: Armistice signed at Panmunjom, establishing the **Demilitarized Zone (DMZ)**.

## 🔑 Causes
- Division of Korea after World War II: Soviet Union occupied the north, U.S. occupied the south.

- Cold War tensions between the U.S. and USSR.

## 🌍 Consequences

- **Legacy**: Often called the “Forgotten War” in the U.S., but central to Korean identity and geopolitics.
