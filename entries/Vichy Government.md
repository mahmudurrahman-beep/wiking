# Vichy Government (État Français)

## Origins
- Established after France’s defeat by Germany in **June 1940**.  
- The French Third Republic collapsed, and Marshal **Philippe Pétain** assumed power.  
- Headquarters moved to **Vichy**, a spa town in central France.  

## Structure
- Officially called the **French State (État Français)**.  
- Led by Pétain as Chief of State, with **Pierre Laval** as a key collaborator.  
- Adopted the motto: **“Travail, Famille, Patrie” (Work, Family, Fatherland)**, replacing “Liberty, Equality, Fraternity.”  

## Policies
- Collaborated with Nazi Germany, including economic and military cooperation.  
- Implemented **anti-Semitic laws** and assisted in the deportation of Jews.  
- Suppressed political opposition and promoted authoritarian nationalism.  

## Division of France
- **Occupied Zone:** Northern and western France under direct German control.  
- **Free Zone:** Southern France governed by Vichy until 1942, when Germany occupied it fully.  

## Collapse
- Allied landings in **Normandy (June 1944)** and liberation of Paris ended Vichy’s authority.  
- Leaders, including Pétain and Laval, were tried for treason after the war.  
- Pétain was sentenced to death, later commuted to life imprisonment.  

## Legacy

- Its legacy remains controversial, with debates about responsibility and resistance.
