## Definition
The **Crusades** were a series of wars sanctioned by the Catholic Church between the 11th and 13th centuries. Their primary goal was to secure Christian control over Jerusalem and other holy sites in the Near East.

## Historical Background

- **1095** – Pope Urban II called the First Crusade at the Council of Clermont, responding to a Byzantine request for aid against the Seljuk Turks.  
- **1096–1099 (First Crusade)** – Captured Jerusalem and established four Crusader states in the Levant.  
- **1147–1149 (Second Crusade)** – Failed attempt to reinforce Crusader states after the fall of Edessa.  
- **1189–1192 (Third Crusade)** – Led by Richard the Lionheart, Philip II of France, and Frederick Barbarossa; ended with a truce with Saladin.  
- **1202–1204 (Fourth Crusade)** – Diverted to Constantinople, leading to the sack of the Byzantine capital.  
- **Later Crusades (13th century)** – Included campaigns in the Holy Land, the Baltic, and Iberia, but ultimately failed to secure lasting Christian control.  
- **1291** – Fall of Acre marked the end of Crusader states in the Middle East.  

## Major Crusades

1. **First Crusade (1096–1099)** – Most successful; established the Kingdom of Jerusalem.  
2. **Second Crusade (1147–1149)** – Failed, weakened Crusader presence.  
3. **Third Crusade (1189–1192)** – Partial success; secured coastal cities but not Jerusalem.  
4. **Fourth Crusade (1202–1204)** – Infamous for sacking Constantinople.  
5. **Later Crusades** – Targeted Muslims, pagans in the Baltic, and heretics in Europe.  

## Consequences

- **Religious Impact** – Deepened Christian–Muslim hostility, but also increased cultural exchange.  
- **Political Impact** – Weakened Byzantine Empire, strengthened papal authority.  
- **Economic Impact** – Stimulated trade between Europe and the Middle East.  
- **Cultural Impact** – Introduced Europeans to new knowledge, technologies, and goods.  

## Legacy

- The Crusades are remembered as both a **holy war** and a **clash of civilizations**, but also as a period of **cross‑cultural contact**.  
- They influenced medieval politics, religion, and economics, and their memory continues to shape Christian–Muslim relations today.
