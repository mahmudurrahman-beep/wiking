# Document Object Model (DOM)

## 📖 Introduction
The **Document Object Model (DOM)** is a programming interface for web documents.  
It represents HTML, XML, or SVG documents as a **tree of nodes**, allowing scripts (like JavaScript) to dynamically change content, structure, and style.

## 🕰️ History / Origins
- Developed in the **1990s** alongside dynamic HTML.  
- Standardized by the **World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)**.  
- Maintained today as the **DOM Living Standard** by **WHATWG**.  

## 🔑 Key Features
- 🌳 **Tree Structure**: Documents are represented as nodes (elements, attributes, text).  
- 🖥️ **Manipulation**:  
  - Add, remove, or modify elements.  
  - Change CSS styles dynamically.  
  - Attach and handle events (clicks, keypresses, etc.).  
- 🌐 **Language Support**: Primarily used with **JavaScript**, but accessible via other languages.  
- ⚡ **Dynamic Power**: Enables interactive features like dropdown menus, animations, and real‑time updates.  

## 🌍 Legacy / Impact
- Core to **modern web development**.  
- Powers frameworks like **React, Angular, Vue**, which abstract DOM manipulation.  
- Essential for **browser APIs** and **event handling**.  

## 🌟 Fun Fact
Although most associated with **JavaScript**, the DOM is technically **language‑agnostic** — any language can use it to manipulate documents!
