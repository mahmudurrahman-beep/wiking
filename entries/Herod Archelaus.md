## 📖 Introduction
Herod Archelaus was a member of the **Herodian dynasty**, inheriting half of his father’s kingdom after Herod the Great’s death.  
He ruled as **ethnarch** rather than king, but his reign was marked by brutality and instability.

## 🕰️ Life & Reign
- **23 BC**: Born to Herod the Great and Malthace (a Samaritan).  
- **4 BC**: Succeeded his father as ethnarch of Judea, Samaria, and Idumea.  
- **Early reign**: Suppressed revolts with extreme violence, including massacres in Jerusalem.  
- **AD 6**: Removed by Emperor Augustus after Jewish and Samaritan complaints.  
- **Exile**: Banished to Gaul, where he died around AD 18.

## 🔑 Characteristics
- **Title**: Ethnarch (not king).  
- **Territory**: Judea, Samaria, Idumea (including Caesarea and Jaffa).  
- **Reputation**: Cruel and unpopular, feared by contemporaries.  
- **Biblical Note**: Mentioned in Matthew 2:22 — Joseph avoided Judea because Archelaus was ruling.

## 🌍 Strategic Importance

- Judea became a **Roman province**, governed by prefects (including Pontius Pilate later).  
- His reign illustrates the fragile balance between local dynasties and Roman authority.

## ⚖️ Legacy
- Remembered as a **tyrant** whose misrule accelerated Roman intervention.  
- His deposition set the stage for direct Roman governance, shaping the political context of Jesus’s lifetime.  
- Archelaus’s coins and inscriptions remain important artifacts for historians.

## 🌟 Fun Fact
