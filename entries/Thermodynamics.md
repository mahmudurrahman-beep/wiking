## Definition
Thermodynamics is the study of how **energy changes** in a system, focusing on heat, work, and temperature. It applies to physics, chemistry, engineering, and even biology.

## The Four Laws of Thermodynamics
1. **Zeroth Law**  
   - If two systems are each in thermal equilibrium with a third, they are in equilibrium with each other.  
   - Basis for the concept of **temperature**.

2. **First Law (Law of Energy Conservation)**  
   - Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed.  
   - Formula:  
     \[
     \Delta U = Q - W
     \]  
     where \(\Delta U\) is change in internal energy, \(Q\) is heat added, and \(W\) is work done.

3. **Second Law**  
   - Entropy (disorder) of an isolated system always increases.  
   - Explains why heat flows from hot to cold and why perpetual motion machines are impossible.

4. **Third Law**  
   - As temperature approaches absolute zero, entropy approaches a constant minimum.  
   - Absolute zero (\(0 \, K\)) is unattainable in practice.

## Applications
- **Engineering:** Engines, refrigerators, turbines.  
- **Chemistry:** Reaction energetics, equilibrium.  
- **Biology:** Metabolism, energy transfer in cells.  
- **Climate Science:** Heat transfer in atmosphere and oceans.  

## Importance
Thermodynamics provides the foundation for understanding **energy efficiency, sustainability, and natural processes**, making it essential across science and technology.
