## 📖 Introduction
The **Monroe Doctrine** is one of the most influential U.S. foreign policy statements.  
Announced by President **James Monroe** in his annual message to Congress on **December 2, 1823**, it opposed European colonialism and intervention in the Americas.

## 🕰️ Historical Context
- Early 19th century: Most Latin American nations were gaining independence from Spain and Portugal.  
- The U.S. feared European powers (especially Spain, France, and Russia) might attempt to reassert control.  
- Britain, with its own interests in trade, informally supported the doctrine.

## 🔑 Core Principles
1. **No new European colonization** in the Americas.  
2. **Non‑interference**: European powers must not meddle in the political affairs of independent nations in the Western Hemisphere.  
3. **U.S. neutrality**: The U.S. would not interfere in European wars or colonies already established.  
4. **Any violation** would be considered a **hostile act** against the United States.

## 🌍 Strategic Importance
- Asserted U.S. leadership in the Western Hemisphere.  
- Became a foundation for later policies, including the **Roosevelt Corollary (1904)**, which expanded U.S. intervention rights.  
- Invoked throughout history, from Cold War containment in Latin America to modern debates over U.S. influence.

## ⚖️ Legacy
- Initially symbolic, as the U.S. lacked military power to enforce it in 1823.  
- Gained weight as U.S. power grew in the late 19th and 20th centuries.  
- Continues to shape U.S. foreign policy discussions, especially regarding Latin America.

## 🌟 Fun Fact
The doctrine wasn’t called the **“Monroe Doctrine”** until the **1850s** — decades after Monroe’s speech.
