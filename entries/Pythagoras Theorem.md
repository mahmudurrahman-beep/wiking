# Pythagoras Theorem

## 📖 Statement
In a **right‑angled triangle**:
- The **hypotenuse** (longest side, opposite the right angle) squared  
- Equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides.  

**Formula:**  


\[
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
\]



## 🕰️ History
- Named after **Pythagoras of Samos (c. 570–495 BCE)**, though known in Babylonian and Indian mathematics earlier.  
- Became a cornerstone of **Euclidean geometry**.  

## 🔑 Applications
- 📏 **Geometry**: Calculating distances and triangle properties.  
- 🗺️ **Navigation**: Finding shortest paths.  
- 🏗️ **Construction**: Ensuring right angles in design.  
- 💻 **Computer Graphics**: Distance calculations in 2D/3D space.  
- 📊 **Trigonometry**: Basis for sine, cosine, and tangent identities.  

## 🌍 Examples
- A **3‑4‑5 triangle**:  
  

\[
  3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 9 + 16 = 25
  \]

  
- A **5‑12‑13 triangle**:  
  

\[
  5^2 + 12^2 = 13^2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 25 + 144 = 169
  \]

  

## 🌟 Fun Fact
The theorem has **hundreds of proofs**, including geometric, algebraic, and even one by **President James Garfield** in 1876.
