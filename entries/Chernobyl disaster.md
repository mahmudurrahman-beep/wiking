## Date & Location
- **Date:** 26 April 1986, 01:23 local time  
- **Location:** Reactor No. 4, Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, Pripyat, Ukrainian SSR (now Ukraine)  

## Cause
- A **poorly designed safety test** combined with **operator errors** led to a sudden power surge.  
- Resulted in **steam explosions** and a fire that destroyed Reactor 4.  
- Released ~5% of the radioactive reactor core into the atmosphere.  

## Immediate Impact
- **Deaths:** 2 workers died instantly; 28 more died within weeks from **acute radiation syndrome**.  
- **Evacuation:** ~49,000 residents of Pripyat evacuated within 36 hours; later expanded to 350,000 people.  
- **Radiation Spread:** Fallout contaminated large parts of Ukraine, Belarus, Russia, and spread across Europe.  

## Long-Term Effects
- **Health:** Thousands of thyroid cancer cases linked to radiation exposure; ongoing debates about total cancer deaths.  
- **Environment:** Exclusion zone (~30 km radius) remains highly contaminated.  
- **Social:** Widespread mistrust of Soviet authorities due to delayed and secretive response.  

## Legacy
- Rated **INES Level 7**, the highest severity for nuclear accidents.  
- Led to major reforms in **nuclear safety and international cooperation**.  
- The damaged reactor was enclosed in a **sarcophagus**, later replaced by the **New Safe Confinement (2016)**.  
- Chernobyl remains a symbol of the dangers of nuclear power mismanagement.
