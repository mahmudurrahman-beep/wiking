## 📖 Introduction
The **F‑117 Nighthawk** was a U.S. Air Force stealth attack aircraft developed by **Lockheed’s Skunk Works** division.  
It was the first operational aircraft designed around stealth technology, optimized to evade radar detection.  
Though often called a “stealth fighter,” it was primarily used as a **ground‑attack aircraft**.

## 🕰️ History
- **Origins**: Developed in the 1970s under the secretive "Have Blue" program.

## 🌍 Strategic Importance
- Revolutionized modern air combat by proving stealth technology in real operations.  
- Allowed U.S. forces to strike targets deep inside enemy defenses with minimal losses.  
- Paved the way for later stealth aircraft like the **B‑2 Spirit** and **F‑22 Raptor**.

## ⚖️ Legacy
- Nicknamed the “Black Jet” due to its distinctive angular design and matte black finish.  
- Symbol of Cold War innovation and U.S. technological superiority.  
- Though retired, it remains iconic as the aircraft that introduced stealth warfare.

## 🌟 Fun Fact
Despite its “F” designation (fighter), the F‑117 had **no air‑to‑air capability** — it was strictly a precision strike aircraft.
