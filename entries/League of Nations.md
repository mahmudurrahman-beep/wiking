The **League of Nations** was an intergovernmental organization founded on **January 10, 1920**, as part of the Paris Peace Settlement following World War I. It was headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, and aimed to promote international cooperation and prevent future conflicts.

## Background

- Proposed by U.S. President Woodrow Wilson in his **Fourteen Points** (1918).  
- Established through the **Treaty of Versailles** and other peace treaties.  
- First meeting held on **January 16, 1920**.  
- Dissolved on **April 18, 1946**, succeeded by the **United Nations**.  

## Structure

- **Assembly** – Included representatives from all member states.  
- **Council** – Smaller body with permanent and non‑permanent members.  
- **Secretariat** – Administrative branch led by the Secretary‑General.  
- **Permanent Court of International Justice** – Judicial organ.  
- **Special Commissions** – Addressed issues like disarmament, health, and refugees.  

## Membership

- At its peak, 58 member states.  
- Major powers like the United States never joined.  
- Germany joined in 1926 but withdrew in 1933.  
- The Soviet Union joined in 1934 but was expelled in 1939.  

## Goals and Functions

1. **Collective Security** – Prevent aggression through joint action.  
2. **Disarmament** – Reduce military capabilities worldwide.  
3. **Conflict Resolution** – Mediate disputes between nations.  
4. **Humanitarian Work** – Address health, labor rights, and refugee crises.  

## Achievements

- Settled minor disputes (e.g., between Finland and Sweden over Åland Islands).  
- Combated global health issues through the Health Organization.  
- Assisted refugees and prisoners of war.  
- Advanced international law and cooperation.  

## Failures

- Lack of enforcement power and absence of the United States weakened its authority.  
- Reliance on unanimous decisions slowed effectiveness.  

## Legacy

- First attempt at a global peacekeeping body.  
- Provided a model for the **United Nations**, which inherited many of its structures.  
- Symbolized the desire for collective security in the interwar period.  

## Key Dates

- **1920, Jan 10** – League of Nations officially established.  
- **1920, Jan 16** – First meeting held.
