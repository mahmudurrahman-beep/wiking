## 📖 Introduction
DNA is the molecule that carries the genetic instructions for all living organisms and many viruses.  
It is the **blueprint of life**, encoding traits and biological processes.

## 🕰️ History / Origins
- **1869**: Friedrich Miescher discovered "nuclein," later identified as DNA.  
- **1953**: James Watson and Francis Crick proposed the **double helix structure**, aided by Rosalind Franklin’s X‑ray diffraction data.  
- DNA became the foundation of **modern genetics**.

## 🔑 Key Features
- **Structure**: Double helix with sugar‑phosphate backbone.  
- **Bases**: Adenine (A), Thymine (T), Cytosine (C), Guanine (G).  
  - A pairs with T, G pairs with C.  
- **Functions**:  
  - Stores genetic information.  
  - Replicates during cell division.  
  - Directs protein synthesis (DNA → RNA → Protein).  
- **Location**: Found in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells and cytoplasm of prokaryotes.

## 🌍 Legacy / Impact
- Enabled breakthroughs in **genetic engineering, DNA fingerprinting, cloning, and CRISPR gene editing**.  
- Central to medicine, agriculture, anthropology, and forensic science.  
- Understanding DNA transformed how we study **evolution and disease**.

## 🌟 Fun Fact
If stretched out, the DNA in a single human cell would be about **2 meters long** — yet it fits inside a microscopic nucleus!
