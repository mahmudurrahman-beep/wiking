- Location: The Solar System is about **27,000 light-years** from the galactic center.  

## Legacy / Impact
- The Milky Way is the most studied galaxy because it is our home.  
- Understanding its structure helps astronomers study galaxy formation and evolution.  
- It is part of the **Local Group**, a cluster of galaxies including Andromeda and Triangulum.  

## Fun Fact 🌟
