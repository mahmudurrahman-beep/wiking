# Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM)

## 📖 Introduction
An **ICBM** is a ballistic missile capable of traveling across continents, designed mainly for **nuclear weapons delivery**.  
Unlike shorter‑range missiles, ICBMs can strike targets thousands of miles away, making them a cornerstone of strategic deterrence.

## 🕰️ History
- **1957**: First U.S. ICBM (SM‑65 Atlas) launched.  
- **1958**: Soviet Union deploys its first ICBMs.  
- **1960s–1970s**: Rapid development during the Cold War, including silo‑based and mobile launch systems.  
- **Present**: Modern ICBMs feature advanced guidance, solid fuel, and multiple warheads.

## 🔑 Capabilities
- **Range**: Greater than 5,500 km (3,400 miles).  
- **Payload**: Typically nuclear warheads; some designs can carry multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (**MIRVs**).  
- **Launch Platforms**: Silo‑based, road‑mobile, rail‑mobile, and submarine‑launched (SLBMs are related but distinct).  
- **Accuracy**: Modern ICBMs use advanced guidance systems for precise targeting.

## 🌍 Operators
Countries with operational ICBMs include:  
- **United States** (Minuteman III, LGM‑35A Sentinel in development)  
- **Russia** (RS‑24 Yars, RS‑28 Sarmat)  
- **China** (DF‑41)  
- **France**  
- **United Kingdom**  
- **India**  
- **Israel**  
- **North Korea**  

👉 **Pakistan** is notable as a nuclear‑armed state without ICBMs.

## ⚖️ Strategic Importance
- **Deterrence**: Central to nuclear strategy; ensures second‑strike capability.  
- **Compellence vs. Deterrence**: ICBMs are more about deterrence — discouraging attack by guaranteeing retaliation.  
- **Cold War Legacy**: Symbolized the nuclear arms race between the U.S. and USSR.

## 🌟 Fun Fact
ICBMs travel into **space** during flight, following a ballistic trajectory before reentering the atmosphere to strike their target.
