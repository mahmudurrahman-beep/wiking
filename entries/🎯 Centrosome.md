## 📖 Introduction
The **centrosome** is an organelle found in animal cells that serves as the **main microtubule‑organizing center (MTOC)**.  
It plays a crucial role in cell division, organizing the mitotic spindle, and maintaining cell shape.

## 🕰️ History / Origins
- First described in **1888** by German zoologist **Theodor Boveri**.  
- Identified as a central structure involved in cell division.  
- Later research revealed its role in microtubule nucleation and regulation of the cytoskeleton.

## 🔑 Key Features
- 🧬 **Structure**:  
  - Composed of two **centrioles** arranged at right angles.  
  - Surrounded by a protein matrix called the **pericentriolar material (PCM)**.  
- ⚡ **Functions**:  
  - Organizes microtubules in the cytoplasm.  
  - Forms the **mitotic spindle** during cell division.  
  - Helps in intracellular transport and positioning of organelles.  
- 🔄 **Duplication**:  
  - Centrosomes duplicate once per cell cycle to ensure proper chromosome segregation.  

## 🌍 Legacy / Impact
- Essential for accurate **cell division** and genetic stability.  
- Defects in centrosome function are linked to diseases such as **cancer** and **microcephaly**.  
- Studied in developmental biology, oncology, and neurobiology.  

## 🌟 Fun Fact
Centrosomes act like the **cell’s GPS system**, guiding microtubules to ensure everything is in the right place during division!
