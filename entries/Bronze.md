## Introduction
**Bronze** is an alloy primarily composed of **copper** and **tin**, though other elements such as aluminum, nickel, or zinc may be added. It is one of the earliest alloys created by humans and played a crucial role in the development of civilization.

## History / Origins
- First produced around **3300 BCE**, marking the beginning of the **Bronze Age**.  
- Early civilizations in Mesopotamia, Egypt, China, and the Indus Valley used bronze for tools, weapons, and art.  
- The widespread use of bronze revolutionized technology, trade, and warfare.  
- Eventually replaced by **iron** in many applications during the Iron Age (around 1200 BCE).  

## Key Features
- **Composition**: Typically 88–90% copper and 10–12% tin.  
- **Properties**: Harder and more durable than pure copper, resistant to corrosion, and easy to cast.  
- **Uses**:  
  - Tools and weapons (swords, axes, spears).  
  - Armor and shields.  
  - Decorative art, sculptures, and coins.  
  - Modern applications include bearings, musical instruments, and marine hardware.  

## Legacy / Impact
