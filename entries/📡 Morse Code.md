## 📖 Introduction
**Morse code** is a method of transmitting text information using sequences of **dots (·)** and **dashes (–)** to represent letters, numbers, and punctuation.  
It was one of the earliest forms of long‑distance communication and is still recognized worldwide.

## 🕰️ History / Origins
- **1830s–1840s**: Developed by **Samuel Morse** and **Alfred Vail** for use with the electric telegraph.  
- First message sent on **May 24, 1844**: *“What hath God wrought”* between Washington, D.C. and Baltimore.  
- Adopted internationally in the **1860s**, with refinements leading to **International Morse Code**.  

## 🔑 Key Features
- 🧩 **Symbols**:  
  - Dot (·) = short signal.  
  - Dash (–) = long signal.  
- 📡 **Transmission**:  
  - Telegraph lines, radio signals, flashing lights, or audible tones.  
- 🌐 **Variants**:  
  - **American Morse Code** (used on railroads).  
  - **International Morse Code** (standardized globally).  
- ⚡ **Applications**:  
  - Telegraphy.  
  - Radio communication (especially in aviation and maritime).  
  - Emergency signaling (SOS = · · · – – – · · ·).  

## 🌍 Legacy / Impact
- Revolutionized **long‑distance communication** in the 19th century.  
- Used extensively in **warfare, navigation, and aviation**.  
- Still taught for emergency communication and as a cultural symbol of early technology.  

## 🌟 Fun Fact
The famous distress signal **SOS (· · · – – – · · ·)** doesn’t stand for words — it was chosen simply because it’s easy to recognize and transmit!
