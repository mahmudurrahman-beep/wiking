## 📖 Introduction
**Mitochria** are double‑membrane organelles found in most eukaryotic cells.  
They are often called the **“powerhouses of the cell”** because they generate ATP, the cell’s main energy currency.

## 🕰️ History / Origins
- First observed in the **19th century** under microscopes.  
- The term *mitochondrion* (Greek: *mitos* = thread, *chondrion* = granule) was coined in **1898** by Carl Benda.  
- Their role in energy production was clarified in the **20th century** with advances in biochemistry.  

## 🔑 Key Features
- 🧬 **Structure**:  
  - Outer membrane (smooth).  
  - Inner membrane (folded into cristae).  
  - Matrix (contains enzymes, DNA, and ribosomes).  
- ⚡ **Functions**:  
  - ATP production via cellular respiration.  
  - Regulation of cell metabolism.  
  - Calcium storage.  
  - Apoptosis (programmed cell death).  
- 📍 **Unique Trait**: Mitochondria have their own **DNA and ribosomes**, allowing them to produce some proteins independently.  
- 🔄 **Endosymbiotic Theory**: Suggests mitochondria originated from free‑living bacteria engulfed by ancestral eukaryotic cells.  

## 🌍 Legacy / Impact
- Essential for **energy metabolism** in all complex life.  
- Dysfunction linked to diseases like **Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, and metabolic disorders**.  
- Studied in aging, bioenergetics, and evolutionary biology.  

## 🌟 Fun Fact
If all the mitochondria in your body were lined up end to end, they would stretch for **about 2,000 kilometers** — roughly the distance from Dhaka to Delhi!
