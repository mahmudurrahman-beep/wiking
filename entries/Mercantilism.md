## Introduction
**Mercantilism** is an economic system and nationalist policy designed to maximize exports and minimize imports. It was the prevailing economic doctrine in Europe from the 16th to the 18th centuries, shaping colonial expansion and global trade.

## History / Origins
- Emerged during the **Age of Exploration**, when European powers sought wealth through overseas colonies.  
- Prominent in countries like **England, France, Spain, and Portugal**.  
- Known by different names: “Colbertism” in France (after Jean-Baptiste Colbert), “Cameralism” in Germany, and “Bullionism” due to its focus on precious metals.  

## Key Features
- **Wealth = Gold & Silver**: National prosperity measured by accumulation of bullion.  
- **Export Surplus**: Encouraged exports while restricting imports.  
- **Colonialism**: Colonies supplied raw materials and served as captive markets.  
- **Government Regulation**: Tariffs, monopolies, and navigation laws controlled trade.  
- **National Power**: Economic policy tied directly to military and political strength.  

## Legacy / Impact
- Fueled European colonial empires and global competition.  
- Criticized by later economists like **Adam Smith**, who argued for free trade in *The Wealth of Nations* (1776).  
- Declined in the late 18th century, replaced by **classical economics** and capitalism.  

## Fun Fact 🌟
Mercantilist policies were one reason behind the **American Revolution** — colonists resented Britain’s trade restrictions and taxes.
