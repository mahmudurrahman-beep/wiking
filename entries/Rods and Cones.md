# Rods and Cones

## 📖 What They Are
Photoreceptors are specialized nerve cells in the retina that detect light.  
There are two main types:
- **Rod cells**: Sensitive to low light, provide night vision.  
- **Cone cells**: Sensitive to bright light, provide color vision.  

## 🔑 Differences Between Rods and Cones

| Feature              | Rod Cells 🌓 | Cone Cells 🌈 |
|----------------------|--------------|---------------|
| **Number in Retina** | ~120 million | ~6 million |
| **Light Sensitivity**| Very high (dim light) | Lower (bright light) |
| **Color Detection**  | None (black & white) | Yes (red, green, blue) |
| **Location**         | Peripheral retina | Central retina (fovea) |
| **Function**         | Night vision, motion detection | Day vision, color perception |
| **Adaptation**       | Slow (dark adaptation) | Fast (light adaptation) |

## 🕰️ How They Work
- **Rods** contain *rhodopsin*, a pigment that reacts to low levels of light.  
- **Cones** contain three pigments (photopsins) tuned to different wavelengths:  
  - **S-cones** (short wavelength, blue)  
  - **M-cones** (medium wavelength, green)  
  - **L-cones** (long wavelength, red)  

## 🌍 Importance
- Rods allow us to see shapes and movement in the dark.  
- Cones give us sharp, colorful vision in daylight.  
- Together, they enable full visual perception across different lighting conditions.
