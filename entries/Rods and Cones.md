# Rods and Cones

## 📖 What They Are
The retina contains two types of photoreceptor cells:
- **Rod cells**: Specialized for vision in dim light, but they don’t detect color.  
- **Cone cells**: Active in bright light and responsible for color vision.

## 🌌 Rod Cells
- Found mostly around the **periphery of the retina**.  
- Extremely sensitive to light, allowing us to see in the dark.  
- Provide **black‑and‑white vision** and help detect motion.  
- Adapt slowly when moving from bright to dark environments (dark adaptation).  

## 🌈 Cone Cells
- Concentrated in the **fovea**, the central part of the retina.  
- Work best in daylight or bright conditions.  
- Responsible for **color vision**:  
  - **S‑cones** detect blue light.  
  - **M‑cones** detect green light.  
  - **L‑cones** detect red light.  
- Provide sharp, detailed vision.  

## 🌍 How They Work Together
- Rods dominate in low‑light situations, giving us night vision.  
- Cones dominate in daylight, giving us color and detail.  
- Together, they allow seamless vision across different lighting conditions.  

## 🌟 Fun Fact
Humans have about **120 million rods** and **6 million cones**, which explains why we see better in dim light than in fine color detail at night.
