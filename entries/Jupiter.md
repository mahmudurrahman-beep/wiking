## Introduction
Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the **largest in the Solar System**. Classified as a gas giant, it is composed mainly of hydrogen and helium. Its immense size and powerful magnetic field make it one of the most influential planets in shaping the Solar System.

## History / Origins
- Known since antiquity; named after **Jupiter**, the king of the Roman gods.  
- Observed by Galileo in 1610, who discovered its four largest moons (the Galilean moons).  
- Studied extensively by spacecraft such as **Pioneer**, **Voyager**, **Galileo**, and **Juno**.  

## Key Features
- Diameter: ~142,984 km (11 times Earth’s).  
- Atmosphere: Thick clouds of hydrogen, helium, ammonia, and methane.  
- Famous for the **Great Red Spot**, a giant storm larger than Earth that has raged for centuries.  
- Moons: At least **95 confirmed moons**, including the Galilean moons — Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto.  
- Magnetic field: The strongest of any planet, creating intense radiation belts.  

## Legacy / Impact
- Jupiter’s gravity influences asteroid belts and protects inner planets by deflecting comets.  
- Its moons are prime targets for astrobiology, especially **Europa**, which may harbor a subsurface ocean.  
- Continues to be a focus of planetary science and exploration missions.  

## Fun Fact 🌟
Jupiter is so massive that it’s **2.5 times the mass of all the other planets combined** — yet it would still need 80 Jupiters to equal the mass of the Sun!
