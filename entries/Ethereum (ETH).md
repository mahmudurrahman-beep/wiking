## Definition
**Ethereum** is a decentralized, open‑source blockchain platform launched in **2015** by **Vitalik Buterin** and a team of developers. Its native cryptocurrency, **Ether (ETH)**, is used to power transactions, smart contracts, and decentralized applications (dApps).

## Origins
- **2013** – Vitalik Buterin proposed Ethereum in a white paper.  
- **2014** – Development funded through a public crowdsale.  
- **2015** – Ethereum network officially launched.  

## Key Features
- **Smart Contracts** – Self‑executing agreements coded directly on the blockchain.  
- **dApps** – Applications built on Ethereum without centralized control.  
- **Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)** – Executes code across the decentralized network.  
- **Proof‑of‑Stake (PoS)** – Since 2022, Ethereum uses PoS for energy‑efficient consensus.  
- **Scalability Solutions** – Layer‑2 networks (e.g., Arbitrum, Optimism) reduce fees and increase speed.  

## Uses
- **Decentralized Finance (DeFi)** – Lending, borrowing, and trading without banks.  
- **NFTs** – Ethereum is the leading platform for non‑fungible tokens.  
- **DAOs** – Decentralized autonomous organizations governed by smart contracts.  
- **Enterprise Solutions** – Used for supply chain, healthcare, and identity systems.  

## Advantages
- Large developer ecosystem and community.  
- Flexibility for building diverse applications.  
- Transition to PoS reduced energy consumption by ~99%.  

## Risks and Challenges
- **Scalability** – High demand causes congestion and high fees.  
- **Competition** – Other blockchains (Solana, Cardano, etc.) challenge Ethereum’s dominance.  
- **Regulation** – Governments continue to debate crypto oversight.  
- **Volatility** – ETH price fluctuates significantly.  

## Future Outlook
- **Ethereum 2.0 upgrades** aim to improve scalability and reduce fees.  
- Layer‑2 solutions expand usability.  
- Expected to remain central to DeFi, NFTs, and Web3 development.
